by the hands of many friends
whose honoured names are
now with the dead, whose kind sympathies
have cheered my checquered existence,
and whose intercourse has often
corrected and enlightened my mind,
leading it to seek in occupation a refuge
from painful feeling. These contributions,
together with original thoughts,
and the gleanings of my own reading,
I presume to offer to the public; with
the hope that where criticism finds
ample cause to condemn, my acknowledged
weakness may plead for indulgence.
Several pages bear the record of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
memories associated with those dear to
me, and of events long past. I presume
to believe, that the perusal of the “<cite>Cairn</cite>,”
cannot injure, and may not fruitlessly
occupy or amuse an idle hour.</p>

the cook to their homely fare, and mingles intoxication

the hard couch with roses, and makes labour
ease. Sorrow doubles the burthen to the beaten
down, plants thorns in the unyielding pillow,
mingles gall with water, adds saltness to their
bitter bread, clothing them in rags and strewing
ashes on their bare heads. To our irremediable
distress every small and petty inconvenience

strong and keen and deep as ever. How indeed
can regret for such a loss be lessened? Can the
thought of a Mother’s love, such a love as mine
bore me, ever lose its charm, its influence? Not,
I am sure, even when the reality is lost; what
it <em>was</em> to me, so it <em>is</em>. Perishable things alone

not dim the diamond; and shall love for the being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>

Charles, the best and greatest patron of the arts

when I turned from the meek placid
features shaded by the plumes of the warrior’s
casque. The comments of my Norman guide
were needless, and in reply to his invectives
against “les Anglais,” I could only sigh, “’Tis
true, ’tis pity—pity ’tis ’tis true.”</p>

of Domremi sur Meuse, and was a servant at

herself in the cause of Charles <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
She was taken prisoner at <i>Compiegn</i> in 1430,
and conducted to <i>Rouen</i>, where, being condemned
as a sorceress by the Ecclesiastical
Power, to which she was given up by the English
chiefs, she was burnt alive in the public

not ensure life to itself? The glorious sun then
appeared to me deserving of worship, until my
mind enquired by whom that sun was made.</p>

<p class="indent">I examined the texture of a flower, and called
it admirable: I watched the motions of an insect,
and beheld its organs perfect: I strove to
build a nest, but the sparrow was the better
workman. I saw the cranes fly against the
wind, and the fishes against the stream, and I
asked, who had taught them thus to protect
their feathers and their scales. I marked the
birds of passage, and said to the new-fledged
swallow prepared for flight, Why thus leave thy
home for distant and unknown regions? Wilt
thou find good and congenial air whither thou
goest? Who instructs thee when to depart?
Who will guide thy course through the trackless
firmament? and how wilt thou know the season
to return? I saw the woodpecker turn her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
eggs, that they might equally receive the vital
warmth; and the partridge trail her wing before
the ensnarer, to beguile his footsteps from her
young. I observed that the wild beasts slept
while man was abroad, and that they sought
their prey while man slept. How equally, said
I, are the waters balanced, and how great the
influence of the stars! The movements of the
planets, the changes of the moon, the repelling
and attracting qualities of the sun, all—all alike
marvellous and sublime. Whom do these things
obey? what hand doth direct the great machinery
of the universe? and for whom were all
these goodly wonders created? I then looked
upon myself: I examined my limbs, my powers,
my senses. There is a Providence! I
cried, and the idols of wood dropped from my
hand. There is but one God! I exclaimed,
the Almighty, Creator of all things in heaven
and on earth, Source of all good and harmony;
and henceforth, Him only will I worship!</p>

<p class="indent">I was remarking one evening to a friend of
my mother’s, the extreme magnificence in the
style of the still beautiful though faded furniture
of the apartments she occupied in Paris, and in
which, at that moment, a large and gay party
were assembled. “True,” replied he, “and I
have seen these rooms in all their splendour,
whilst their lovely, though frail mistress, dispensed
her fascinating smiles upon an admiring
circle. This house was fitted up by the celebrated
<abbr title="Sainte">St.</abbr> Amaranthe, whose fate offers one of
the most striking instances of revolutionary despotism.</p>

<p class="indent">“It is well known that even the stern heart
of the tyrant Robespierre had felt her power,
but this was no security against his atrocious
cruelty. He was one of thirteen guests assembled
on the preceding night in the <i>Rue de Gramont</i>,
where he had partaken of the hospitality
of the beauteous hostess. The next morning,
whilst employed in the duties of his toilette, his
Secretary observed to him that he had drunk
too freely the night before. ‘What leads you
to think so?’ inquired Robespierre, ‘Your unguarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
conversation, Citizen, which I do not
think passed unobserved, either by <abbr title="Sainte">St.</abbr> Amaranthe
or her guests.’ ‘It matters not,’ said the tyrant
with apparent indifference, ‘they will do me no
harm,’ writing at the same moment a note which
he dispatched by a servant, and then with the
utmost composure continued to shave himself.</p>

<p class="indent">“That note conveyed his orders for the
arrest of <abbr title="Sainte">St.</abbr> Amaranthe and the eleven individuals
who had supped with her, one of whom
was her son, a boy of thirteen; and on the following
day, the only two of the party of fourteen
who were not led to the guillotine were
<em>Robespierre</em> and <em>his Secretary</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">“<abbr title="Sainte">St.</abbr> Amaranthe dressed herself with peculiar
care for her execution, and a person who
by chance saw her pass in the fatal cart which
conducted her to death, described to me the
beauty and elegance of the figure, around which
the most tastefully arranged draperies of <em>yellow</em>
crape floated on the air.”</p>

silver, and that the value was trifling, he became
furious, ran to the palace of the Duke, and before
his face, broke the statue in pieces. The
figure being an image of our Saviour, he was
accused of heresy, and consigned to the Inquisition,
and that tribunal sentenced him to a
severe castigation, which the indignant artist
escaped by starving himself to death in prison,
previous to the time appointed for the execution

observer of omens, and a singular instance

four times defeated in his attempts to recover
and secure the crown of Scotland, he was on
the point of abandoning all future opposition to
what appeared to be his fate, and to go to the
Holy Land. It chanced that his eyes, as he
was thus pondering, were attracted by the exertions
of a <em>spider</em>, which, in order to fix his
web, endeavoured to swing himself from one
beam to another above his head. Involuntarily
he became interested in the pertinacity with
which the insect renewed its exertions after
failing six times; and it occurred to him, that
he would decide his own course according to
the success or failure of that of the spider. At
the <em>seventh</em> effort the insect gained its object,
and Bruce, in like manner, persevered and carried
his own.</p>

a wise man. Are we to fly from ourselves

fondly imagine that the disease is cured because
we find means to get some few minutes from

physician of brutes, a lingering and uncertain
deliverance? Shall we wait to be happy, till
we can forget we are miserable? and owe to
the weakness of our faculties a tranquillity
which ought to be the effect of our strength?
Far otherwise, let us set all our past and present
afflictions at once before our eyes; let us
resolve to overcome them, instead of flying
from them, or wearing out the sense of them
by a long and ignominious patience; instead of
palliating remedies, let us use the incision knife

opened it, and found nothing but a blank paper,

turning the paper on both sides, “here is nothing,

<p><span class="first">A</span> <span class="looks_big">susceptibility</span> to delicate attentions,

grosser qualities. There are many who waste
and lose affections by careless and, often, unconscious
neglect. It is not a plant to grow
untended; the breath of indifference, or rude
touch, may destroy for ever its delicate texture.
There is a daily attention to the slight courtesies
of life, which can alone preserve the first
freshness of passion. The easy surprises of
pleasure, earnest cheerfulness of assent to slight
wishes, the habitual respect to opinions, the
polite abstinence from personal topics in the
company of others, unwavering attention to his
and her comfort, both abroad and at home, and
above all, the careful preservation of those proprieties
of conversation and manner which are
sacred when before the world, are some of the
secrets of that rare happiness which age and

considerable space along the banks of
the Thames, contiguous to where Westminster
Bridge now stands; commencing at the present
Privy Gardens, and ending near Scotland Yard.
It extended also from the River to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s
Park, along the boundary of which, including
the Cockpit and Spring Gardens, many of its
buildings were situated. Hubert de Burgh,
Justiciary of England in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
who was its first owner, left it in 1242 to the
Monastery of Black Friars, Holborn, who selling
it to Walter Gray, Archbishop of York, it
subsequently became the property of succeeding
prelates, and was the York House more than
once mentioned by Shakespeare. Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>
taking a fancy to it, Wolsey, as Archbishop of
York, found it prudent to dispose of the Palace
to that arbitrary monarch, from whose time it
became the residence of the sovereigns of
England till 1695, when it was consumed by
fire; and Queen Anne in consequence removed
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s. Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> threw a gallery
across the street to the new Park of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s,
which was formed about the same time from
the grounds of a dissolved monastery of this
name, and erected on that side of the way a
Cockpit, a Tennis Court, &amp;c. Many of Cromwell’s
letters about this time are dated from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Cockpit, whilst his subsequent ones are usually
dated Whitehall. The Banqueting House, now
commonly called Whitehall, which was built by
James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> in the room of an old building devoted
by Elizabeth to a similar purpose, alone escaped
the fire; and still remains a monument of the
purer taste introduced by Inigo Jones. It was
the only part of the intended new structure built
by him. The roof was painted by Rubens,
1629, who received from Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> three thousand
pounds and knighthood for his labour.</p>

been the object of a thousand tender solicitudes,
a thousand waking watchful cares, of meek

Porter, who when they were dragging Jesus
out of the door of the Judgment Hall, struck
him on the back, saying, “Go faster, Jesus,
go faster—why dost thou linger?” upon which
Jesus looked upon him with a frown, and said,
“I am indeed going, but thou shalt tarry till I
come.” Soon after he was converted, and
took the name of Joseph. He lives for ever,
but at the end of every <em>hundred</em> years falls into
a fit or trance, from which, when he recovers,
he returns to the same age as he was when our
Saviour suffered, being then about thirty years.
He always preserves the utmost gravity of deportment.

He who had received from his Sovereign an
absolute title to the lands on the wilful subterfuge
of Christian and heathen rights to the soil—but
who, acting upon the principle of “uniform
justice,” never would invade a foot of
territory which he had not before purchased
from the Indians. Penn considered immemorial
occupancy superior to all other tenure,
that this right of the Red-man was founded in
nature, that this tenure was the free gift of
Heaven, which no king, no pope, no man had
a right to question, or any equitable pretence to
destroy; and therefore his principles required
him to commence with justice to the natural
occupant of the soil. With the founder of
Pensylvania, the measures he adopted, and his
demeanour towards the aborigines were wise,
and so happy that it became a maxim among
them “never to lift the tomahawk against the
race of William Penn.” The country of
William Penn was called “the Poor Man’s
Paradise;” poverty was unknown in all its
borders.</p>

<p class="indent">With reference to the name given to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
colony, it is stated by Penn on the 5th Jan.
1681: “This day, after many waitings, watchings,
solicitings, and disputes in Counsel, my
country was confirmed to me under the Great
Seal of England, with large powers and privileges,
by the name of Pensylvania, a name the
king would give it in honour of my father.
I chose <em>New Wales</em>, being a hilly country; and
when the Secretary, being a Welshman, refused
to call it New Wales, I proposed Sylvania,
and they added <em>Penn</em> to it, though I much opposed
it, and went to the king to have it struck
out. He said it was past, and would take it
upon him. I feared it should look like a vanity
in me, and not as a respect of the king to my
father, as it really was.”</p>

I should be inexcusable if I readily believed
what is said of others. What I have

When I have the evidence of my

<p class="indent">Recollect—that it is vacuity which requires
the charm of novelty: keep the soul replete
with genuine bliss, and the desire of change
will never make head against the power of pure
and mutual love. The cooling of the heart
towards the object once adored, proceeds in
general from the weakness of unoccupied hours,
and the inaction of sensibility. Kind attentions
mutually kept up, will always endear even indifferent
persons to each other; and will not the
very name of husband, and wife, lead to those
attentions, to those endearments? The flame
of love once raised, will burn long if fanned by
both the votaries; but will inevitably expire if
left only to the care of one.</p>

such an impression. Yet so it is, in sober
earnest. I think it was two days at least before
the effect of even one bath went off; and when,
forgetting what manner of man or woman we
had become in it, we afterwards happened to
pass our hands over our foreheads, either for

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">n</span> the thirteenth century the two chief meals
were dinner and supper, the first at nine in
the morning, the supper at five in the afternoon.
The greatest luxury and magnificence were
displayed at those repasts, and the side tables
were highly ornamented, and covered with
various fermented liquors, as mead, ale, beer,
and, above all, rich wines of English growth.
At the celebration in London of the marriage
of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and Cincia,
daughter of Redmond, Earl of Provence (<span class="allsmcap">A.&thinsp;D.</span>
1243), there were above thirty thousand dishes
served at the marriage dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">An unlimited hospitality reigned in the castles
of great barons: their gates were ever open to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
strangers of condition, as well as their own
vassals, friends, and followers. It is evident
that the immense halls to be seen in the remains
of ancient structures, were built to accommodate
vast numbers of guests of all ranks; and
the little window above, opening from a recess
of the state apartment, was evidently intended
in order that the guests should be seen assembling,
before the lord of the mansion and persons
of dignity went down to the common
repast. In the middle of each table stood a
large salt-cellar, and it was a mark of distinction
whether a person sat above or below the
salt. Particular care was taken to place the
guests according to their rank.</p>

<h3 id="81Scen" class="sidenote">Scenes
from the
Life of
Titian.</h3>

<p><span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">itian Vecelli</span> was born in 1477,
at the Chateau of La Pieve, on the frontiers
of Friuli, one of the seven Communes of
Cador. He was by birth a gentleman, his
father was Gregorio Vecelli, and his ancestors
were traced to the twelfth century.</p>

<p class="indent">Here may be corrected an absurdity often
committed in designating him as “<em>Le</em> Titien,”
<em>that</em> being his baptismal name; as well say <em>the</em>
Raphael—or <em>the</em> Michael Angelo. The artist
may certainly be denominated “<em>The Vecelli</em>.”</p>

<p class="indent">Titian was not six years of age when he first
gave notice of the great art in which he was to
shine so bright a star: and even then, may be
traced his transcendent genius in the power of
colouring. The infant artist took his tints
from nature. The fields, the gardens were his
palettes; it was his custom to gather flowers,
from which he expressed the juices; he required
no pencil, no pen, to sketch his designs, he had
discovered the fresco; instinct perfected his
work; the perfume of the flower was unheeded
by this wonderful child, but he would fall in
extacies at the whiteness of the lily, the carnation
of the rose, the purple of the iris.</p>

<p class="indent">Titian was united in a band of most intimate
friendship with Giorgione, who had arrived
from Castel-Franco, to study under Bellini,
(Titian’s master) and who called himself simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
“George.” He soon became the friend, the
brother, the model of Titian; and when, in after
years, his jealousy of Titian’s talent went to
such lengths as to separate them, the latter left
Venice, not being able to endure a residence in
the same city, with Giorgione thus alienated
from him, nor did he ever return to Venice till
after the death of Giorgione.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1514, Alphonso d’Este, the reigning Duke
of Ferrara, called Titian to his court, which at
that period was considered the most brilliant
and magnificent in Italy. Poets, Painters,
every artist of celebrity was there admitted, and
honoured in proportion to his talents. Titian’s
long cherished dream of ambition and well
earned fame, were now about to be realized,
and his glorious talent to be estimated as it deserved.
Although poor in fortune, there was no
gentleman at the court of Alphonso who could
vie with him in the good taste and elegance of
his appearance. His manners were those of a
high bred man: his conversation full of charm.
The Prince soon felt the superiority of his new
guest, and treated him with peculiar courtesy.</p>

<p class="indent">“Signor Titian,” said Alphonso, “consider
our house as your own, and be at perfect ease
and freedom: my dearest wish is to render it
so agreeable to you, as to induce you to remain
with us. It shall be our care that your residence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
at Ferrara may lessen your regret at quitting
your beautiful Venice! Recollect though,
that here pleasure takes the precedence of business;
however, if in your leisure hours you should
take up your pencil, we know too well how to
appreciate your reputation and your talent, not
to recollect at proper seasons that our court is
honoured by the presence of the first painter in
Venice.”</p>

<p class="indent">Alphonso’s conduct towards Titian fully bore
out his professions, and his favour, by giving to
the artist the full scope of his enthusiasm in his
art, left to Titian nothing to desire. His sojourn
at this court was terminated by an event
which not only proves the estimation with
which the duke honoured him, but gives also
some idea of the morals of the period of which
we speak.</p>

<p class="indent">Alphonso, thinking the favour which he had
bestowed on Titian entitled him to make the request,
one day entreated the great artist would
gratify him by taking the portrait of Dona
Laura Eustochio d’Este, the reigning Duchess
of Ferrara.</p>

<p class="indent">“Listen to me, my dear Titian,” said the
prince, in a tone of cordial intimacy, “you are
not ignorant (for every thing is known at a
court), that it was the surpassing beauty of my
wife which induced me to marry her, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
will easily believe how much it will gratify me,
if by your pencil her charms are rendered immortal.
I know not whether the ducal mantle
will be allowed to fall at your request, this favour
it must be your task to obtain of the Duchess,
but understand me well, great master, that my
ardent desire is that by your talent I should be
possessed of the faithful copy of those transcendent
charms, which have so enslaved me; and
divested of all veil or drapery, as though reflected
in a mirror, such as are seen in your delightful
paintings—so that in after times, when she is
represented (such as I knew and adored her),
it may be said, ‘her beauty was perfect; he
was not to blame for marrying her!’”</p>

<p class="indent">“Monsignore,” replied Titian, “although
the artist sees and thinks only as of a model, in
the woman who is before him, were she a
queen, yet I will confess to your Highness,
that I have so seldom seen the Duchess since
I have had the honour of residing at your court,
and at such times she has appeared to look on
me with so much coldness and dignity, that
even by your order, I never could venture to
prescribe what attitude and costume would be
most suitable: and I really think that this
would be best intimated by your Highness.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Not at all, my dear Titian, you know
nothing of women. It suffices that a husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
wishes one thing, for them to press another.
What objections, what remonstrances, what
reproaches I should have to endure! She
would insist that I had ceased to love her, and
was no longer jealous—whilst you would only
speak as the painter, and would be listened to
and believed, for when Titian had said ‘On my
honour, Madam, I can make you a Venus,’
where is the woman who could oppose him?
In short, Titian, you know my wishes, do the
best you can; the Duchess expects you;” and
in fact the Prince had scarcely left the room,
when two pages announced that the Duchess
of Ferrara waited for him.</p>

<p class="indent">In a room richly embellished with all the
luxury of art, and which would have inspired
Ariosto with the enchantment of Armida’s palace,
the Duchess reclined on cushions, which
yielded to every movement, a young page of
such beauty as is described in Raphael’s angels,
gently waved a fan of peacock’s feathers, and
a little Ethiopian slave knelt at his mistress’s
feet, as though placed there in order to display
the whiteness of her skin by the contrast.</p>

<p class="indent">Into this scene Titian followed his conductor,
but was struck dumb, and seized as if
with vertigo: he thought himself transported
into some region of fancy. On a sign from
their mistress a seat, the easel, the palette, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
pencils and the colours were presented to the
artist, and the attendants lowly bowing withdrew,
leaving Titian and the Duchess alone.</p>

<p class="indent">The beauty of Laura is historical, and it
were difficult to give any adequate description
of it. When Titian had recovered sufficient
self-command to render the feelings of the man
subservient to those of the artist, he raised his
eyes, and fixed them on the Duchess; it was the
first time he had ever ventured to do so, for, as
he had hinted, Laura had ever appeared desirous
of avoiding him; but recollecting that he was
now in her presence by the orders of the Prince,
and by nature of his business, he continued his
gaze, and met in return her gracious smile.
Strange, it even seemed to him that he had
seen that face before—long since—in a dream
possibly—or when the artist’s imagination was
inspired by some ideal beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">Titian drew the easel towards him, and
respectfully bowing, said, “Madam, I am here
by your order.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Am I well placed thus, Sir Artist?” she
replied.</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of this voice thrilled every nerve.
He was now certain that it was not the first
time they had met; but when, where, or in
what country he had seen this woman, he had
no recollection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The Duchess with a little of impatience repeated
her question.</p>

<p class="indent">“Perfectly, Madam,” replied Titian, beginning
at the same time to sketch the outline of
the head.</p>

<p class="indent">“However,” he added, somewhat hesitating,
“if your Highness would show more of the
hair, I think the portrait would be improved.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Of course, Signor Titian, your advice is
law.” And the Duchess proceeded to unbind
her veil, and remove the jewels which confined
those beautiful tresses, which like a golden
shower fell on her snow white neck and shoulders.
“What magnificent hair!” exclaimed
the artist in an under tone; “yes, surely I have
seen this woman before; but then she had not
the transcendent beauty she has since attained,
and which now renders her the most perfect
model a painter could wish.”</p>

<p class="indent">Titian worked on as if inspired; and when
the head and part of the shoulders were sufficiently
advanced to allow the artist to satisfy
the curiosity of the fair original, Titian permitted
the Duchess to look at the canvass.
On beholding the likeness, and the beauty of
the sketch, Laura d’Este uttered a cry of surprise
and admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">“You see, Madam, how much has been
gained by yielding to my request to remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that heavy head dress, and you will, I hope,
equally comply with my wish to see that gown
taken off; attend, I beg you, Madam, to an
artist’s advice—uncover those shoulders, so perfect
in shape, that bust, so exquisitely formed,
the contour of which is perfection. Surely it
was not to paint a bit of stuff, or a knot of riband
that God has endowed us with a talent of
creation only secondary to his own great power;
for I too can give life to that world of beauty,
and when it shall have ceased to exist, it will
survive on my canvass.”</p>

<p class="indent">“I no longer wonder that I was told to beware
of Titian,” said the Duchess, as she gradually
obeyed the painter’s directions; “our
great Ariosto is not the only flatterer at our
court.”</p>

<p class="indent">“If, Madam, you doubt my word, consult
this mirror; its reflection is not more true than
my language.”</p>

<p class="indent">As by degrees the Duchess, in compliance
with Titian’s wishes, uncovered her foot, her
leg, her knee—the whole of the admirable form
which had placed on her fair brow the crown
of Ferrara—Titian recalled the past; the vague
ideas which had floated in his brain assumed
consistency, and a name, a date, were all left
wanting to satisfy him.</p>

<p class="indent">And now the exquisite outline was nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
complete; one only obstacle remained, the
few folds of velvet which like a dark shade fell
on the form of snow white beauty, and prevented
this master-piece of art from shining
forth in all its dazzling perfection.</p>

<p class="indent">“How happy was that artist,” exclaimed
Titian with bitterness, “whose chisel was suffered
to sculpture the Venus of old in all the
chaste nudity of nature! He did not look on
diamonds and draperies. Oh! were the same
privilege given me, this day should my pencil
also produce a Venus de Medicis!”</p>

<p class="indent">“Behold me, then!” exclaimed the Duchess,
half laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">Titian, turning round, uttered a cry of amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">The wife of Don Alphonso of Ferrara had
dropped her last veil, and reclined on her divan
precisely in the same attitude in which at this
time Titian’s Venus may still be seen with delight
in the gallery at Florence.</p>

<p class="indent">“Great God! I was not then mistaken,”
said Titian, hurrying towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">“Well!”</p>

<p class="indent">“It is you!”</p>

<p class="indent">“It is me. Your model—your Laurette!
Ungrateful man! you had then forgotten me!”</p>

<p class="indent">“Can I believe it? the daughter of poor
Guanetto?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p class="indent">“Yes, she, who for a morsel of bread came
to stand in your studio as a model, at Venice,
is now the Sovereign of Ferrara. But the most
surprising part of the event is, that her old lord
and master persisted in his forgetfulness, and
refused to recognise the Duchess of Ferrara
till she had again descended to her humble
capacity of a model.”</p>

<p class="indent">“I thought, indeed, those features were not
unknown to me.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Well, this is something.—However, I forgive
you. Twelve years have elapsed, and I
must be much altered.”</p>

<p class="indent">“And how did you attain your present position?”</p>

<p class="indent">“As the wife of Don Alphonso? Simply
thus. He saw me, loved me, and married me—nothing
more natural.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Yes, he loves you, I have the proof of this.”</p>

<p class="indent">“He adores me. Ever since your arrival at
Ferrara, he has entreated me to give him this
portrait. I avoided it as long as I could, but
was at length obliged to consent to prevent his
being seriously grieved. God knows, I dreaded
the moment enough! for....” And the
young woman hesitated, and sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">“I understand: prudence bade you avoid
me.”</p>

<p class="indent">“No, it was shame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Titian bowed down his head, and appeared
buried in thought: when he had somewhat recovered
himself, and was able to speak—“Come,
Madam,” he said kindly but firmly, “replace
your splendid robe, and adjust your head-dress.
This sketch is now useless, and I will complete
it another time. In my studio I have a
portrait of you such as the Prince desires to
possess. But I wish also to paint you for your
subjects: since fate has placed a sovereign
crown on your head, it shall not be said that I
have deprived you of it, even in a picture.”</p>

<p class="indent">“But what will my husband say?”</p>

<p class="indent">“He can but be pleased; for instead of the
one portrait ordered, there will be two—one as
a Venus, the other as a Princess.”</p>

<p class="indent">Three days afterwards, Titian had returned
to Venice....</p>

<p class="indent">Titian at this period was about thirty-seven
years of age. He was tall and dignified, his
forehead high, his eyes large and full of expression
and feeling, his profile was correctly
Grecian, his long beard curled naturally, he
was framed to inspire respect and love. His
manners were all grace, his smile enchanting.</p>

<p class="indent">After his return to Venice, he lived in princely
style, so as to vie even with the splendour of
the palace of the Doge. Affable, cheerful,
generous, he was beloved even by his rivals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
No artist ever acquired such wealth, or lavished
it more generously and willingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pacheco.
Granella.</div>

<p class="indent">Two Cardinals one day called unexpectedly
at his <i>Atelier</i>, and told him they came to dine
with him. Titian detained them a short time
under pretence of retouching their portraits,
and when unobserved, threw his purse out of
the window, saying to a servant, “I have some
one to dinner.” In an hour after, their Eminences
sat down to a repast served with regal
splendour.</p>

<p class="indent">Titian’s studio was the resort and rendezvous
of every remarkable personage in Europe: from
every quarter of the world people hurried to
behold the venerable old man, who approached
his hundredth year. Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> King of
France and Poland, attended by the Dukes of
Ferrara, Mantua, and Albano, paid a visit of
ceremony to the distinguished artist, and conversed
at length with him on the subject of his
honourable reception at the several courts of
Charles <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> and of Ferdinand and Philip. He
admired all his collection of pictures, and having
selected those he was desirous of purchasing, he
begged that Titian would himself name the sum
he should pay for them, and which should be
immediately laid down. The old man smiled,
and rising with some difficulty from his chair,
he bowed respectfully to the king, saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
“Your Majesty will confer on me the favour
of accepting these pictures, as a proof of my
gratitude. I never take money from my
guests.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope.</div>

<p class="indent">Titian was unequalled in his talent for giving
<em>life</em> to his portraits. It is an undoubted fact
that having placed the portrait of Paul <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> on
his terrace, to dry the varnish, the people who
passed by, supposing it to be really the Pope
taking the air on the balcony, stopped to bow
with reverence to his Holiness.</p>

<p class="indent">Titian died of the plague raging in Venice,
in 1576. Regrets and tears followed the
splendid artist to the tomb, in the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Luc, where he was interred with the highest
honours.</p>

<p><span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">he</span> Rainbow Coffee-house, near Temple
Bar, one of the oldest taverns in the
metropolis, was kept by James Fan, a barber,
soon after the introduction of coffee into England.
Three years previous to the Restoration,
anno 1657, he was presented by the Inquest
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan’s in the West, “For making
and selling a sort of liquor called ‘Coffee,’ as
a great nuisance and prejudice of the neighbourhood,”
&amp;c. Strange as it may appear,
within half a century of this period, namely in
1708, there were upwards of three thousand
Coffee-houses in London alone. An old author
says, Who would have thought, after the prejudice
against coffee, which was considered pernicious
and a public nuisance, it would have
been, as now, so much drunk “by the <em>best of
quality</em>, and by <em>physicians</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="first">H</span><span class="looks_big">er</span> writings are not better known to the
world, than her kind and generous mind
were to those who had remained faithful during
her many and great reverses of fortune. In the
zenith of power, when her smile or frown
could give value or discredit to those who surrounded
her, she was a friend of the needy, a
protectress of the weak. Her position often
created envy, but her winning manner, her
graceful accueil converted many an envious
discontented spirit into an admiring friend. In
her trials and reverses she was made to feel
how few are the friends and followers of prosperity
whose feelings do not become chilled by
the sight of adversity.</p>

<p class="indent">The same kind and conciliatory manner, the
same noble enthusiasm, the same powers of
conversation, refined and heightened by the
literary career she had adopted to ward off the
actual and pressing gripe of poverty, were still
hers; but their value was differently estimated.
The small and modest apartment could boast
of but few of the <i>habitués</i> who had formerly
swelled to suffocation the crowd that formerly
frequented her gilded <i>salons</i>. Some few were
to be found, however, surrounding her couch
of pain, and never had she taken so much
trouble to court and conciliate the richest
nobles, the reigning princes of her own and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
other lands, as she now did to show her cordial
welcome, and the heartfelt pleasure she felt in
beholding the faithful few, who dreamed not
while listening to her brilliant wit, her sparkling
reminiscences of bright fêtes in which she had
been a principal actress, that the finger of death
was already on her, that her moments of life
and vivacity freely given for their amusement,
were stimulated by the excessive use of opium,
while her hours of racking pain and mental anguish
were confined to her own bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">She died in poverty; she who had given
away in charity a hundred times more than
would have made her last days comparatively
affluent and easy—died in want. Her last days,
nay hours, disturbed by pressing, though trifling
demands. She died in an <i>Hospital</i> for the destitute.</p>

<p class="indent">I am proud to remember that she honoured
me with her esteem and friendship.</p>

so much treasure that he returned to England

<p class="center"><i>Letter of Marian Delorme to <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Cinq. Mars.</i></p>

<p class="from">Paris, Feb. 1641.</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Effiat,</p>

<p><span class="first">W</span><span class="looks_big">hile</span> you are forgetting me at Narbonne,
and giving yourself up to the
pleasures of the court and the delight of thwarting
<abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> le Cardinal de Richelieu, I, according
to your express desire, am doing the honours
of Paris to your English lord, the Marquis of
Worcester; and I carry him about, or rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
he carries me, from curiosity to curiosity,
choosing always the most grave and serious,
speaking very little, listening with extreme attention,
and fixing on those whom he interrogates
two large blue eyes, which seem to pierce
to the very centre of their thoughts. He is remarkable
for never being satisfied with any explanations
which are given him; and he never
sees things in the light in which they are shown
him: you may judge of this by a visit we made
together to Bicêtre, where he imagined he had
discovered a genius in a madman. If this madman
had not been actually raving, I verily believe
your Marquis would have entreated his
liberty, and have carried him off to London, in
order to hear his extravagancies, from morning
till night, at his ease. We were crossing the
court of the madhouse, and I, more dead than
alive with fright, kept close to my companion’s
side, when a frightful face appeared behind
some immense bars, and a hoarse voice exclaimed,
“I am not mad! I am not mad! I
have made a discovery which would enrich the
country that adopted it.” “What has he discovered?”
I asked of our guide. “Oh!” he
answered, shrugging his shoulders, “something
trifling enough; you would never guess it: it
is the use of the steam of boiling water.” I
began to laugh. “This man,” continued the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
keeper, “is named Solomon de Caus: he came
from Normandy four years ago, to present to
the king a statement of the wonderful effects
that might be produced from his invention.
To listen to him, you would imagine that with
steam you could navigate ships, move carriages,
in fact, there is no end to the miracles which,
he insists upon it, could be performed. The
Cardinal sent the madman away without listening
to him. Solomon de Caus, far from being
discouraged, followed the Cardinal wherever
he went, with the most determined perseverance,
who, tired of finding him for ever in his
path, and annoyed to death with his folly, ordered
him to be shut up in Bicêtre, where he
has now been for three years and a half, and
where, as you hear, he calls out to every visitor
that he is not mad, but that he has made a
valuable discovery. He has even written a book
on the subject, which I have here.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Lord
Worcester, who had listened to this account
with much interest, after reflecting a time,
asked for the book, of which, after having read
several pages, he said, “This man is not mad.
In my country, instead of shutting him up, he
would have been rewarded. Take me to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
for I should like to ask him some questions.”</p>

<p class="indent">He was, accordingly, conducted to his cell,
but after a short time, he came back sad and
thoughtful—“He is, indeed, mad now,” said
he, “misfortune and captivity have alienated
his reason, but it is you who have to answer
for his madness: when you cast him into that
cell, you confined the greatest genius of the
age.”</p>

<p class="indent">After this, we went away, and since that
time he has done nothing but talk of Solomon
de Caus.</p>

<p class="indent">Adieu, my dear friend and faithful Henry.
Make haste and come back, and pray do not be
so happy where you are, as not to keep a little
love for me.</p>

<h3 id="118The" class="sidenote">The
Plague.</h3>

<p><span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">he</span> fearful progress and effects of the
dreadful pestilence which visited England
during the reign of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> are traced by
a masterly hand in the work from which this
extract is made.</p>

<p class="indent">“In the malignancy of this extraordinary
disease, it engrossed the ill of all other maladies,
and made doctors despicable. Of a potency
equal to death, it possessed itself of all its
armouries, and was itself the death of every other
mortal distemper. The touch, yea, the very
sight of the infected was deadly; and its signs
were so sudden, that families seated in happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
at their meals, have seen the <em>plague-spot</em>
begin to redden, and have wildly scattered
themselves for ever. The cement of society
was dissolved by it. Mothers, when they saw
the sign of the infection on the babes at their
bosom cast them from them with abhorrence.
Wild places were sought for shelter: some
went into ships, and anchored themselves afar
off on the waters. But the angel that was
pouring the vial had a foot on the sea as well
as on the dry land. No place was so wild that
the plague did not visit,—none so secret that
the quick-sighted pestilence did not discover—none
could fly that it did not overtake.</p>

<p class="indent">“It was as if Heaven had repented the
making of mankind, and was shovelling them
all into the sepulchre. Justice was forgotten,
and her courts deserted. The terrified jailors
fled from the felons that were in fetters; the
innocent and the guilty leagued themselves together,
and kept within their prisons for safety;
the grass grew in the market places; the cattle
went moaning up and down the fields, wondering
what had become of their keepers: the
rooks and the ravens came into the towns, and
built their nests in the mute belfries; silence
was universal, save when some infected wretch
was seen clamouring at a window.</p>

<p class="indent">“For a time all commerce was in coffins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>and shrouds; but even that ended. Shrift
there was none; churches and chapels were
open, but neither priests nor penitent entered;
all went to the charnel-house. The sexton
and the physician were cast into the same deep
and wide grave; the testator and his heirs and
executors were hurled from the same cart into
the same hole together. Fire became extinguished,
as if its element too had expired; the
seams of the sailorless ships yawned to the sun.
Though doors were open, and coffers unwatched,
there was no theft; all offences ceased,
and no cry but the universal woe of the pestilence
was heard of among men. The wells
overflowed, and the conduits ran to waste; the
dogs banded themselves together, having lost
their masters and ran howling over all the land;
horses perished of famine in their stalls; old
friends but looked at one another when they
met, keeping themselves far aloof; creditors
claimed no debts, and courtiers performed their
promises; little children went wandering up
and down, and numbers were seen dead in all
corners. Nor was it only in England that the
plague raged; it travelled over a third part of
the whole earth, like the shadow of an eclipse,
as if some dreadful thing had been interposed
between the world and the sun-source of life.”</p>

<h3 id="122Marg" class="faux">Margaret of Anjou and Renè of Sicily.</h3>
<p><span class="first">S</span><span class="looks_big">o</span> little resemblance in character was there
between Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry
<abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> and her father Renè, King of Sicily and
Jerusalem, that it is related of him, that when
the news of the loss of one of his kingdoms
was brought to him, while he was engaged in
painting a partridge from nature, he paid no
attention to the communication, nor would he
see the messenger till he had given the finishing
strokes to his design. Renè’s compositions
in music, are at this very time the delight of
his native country, and indeed of Europe. He
was the inventor of the Opera ballet; and the
drama of <cite lang="fr">La Tentation</cite>, lately revived with so
much splendour at Paris in 1832, was originally
composed by this Prince. The wild story is
his own, and the delightful melodies his composition,
which have been merely tamed and
regulated by modern art. This Prince, adored
for his beneficence by his people, who named
him the “<em>Good</em>,” was scorned by the destructive
nobles of his era as <i lang="fr">fainéant</i> and feeble-minded.
After the death of his first wife, Isabella
of Lorraine, he married Jeanne de Lovel.
She was of so grave a character, that she was
never known to laugh but once, at a pageant
devised by her royal husband—namely, a boat
filled with water-pipes, which played on every
side, and completely drenched the spectators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
that did not use some agility in getting out of
the way.</p>

<p class="indent">Margaret’s elder sister, Yolente, survived
her two years; she had a beautiful daughter
called Margaret of Anjou the younger. Maria
Louisa, Napoleon’s Empress, possessed the
breviary of this Princess, in which there is one
sentence supposed to have been written by the
once beautiful, powerful, and admired Margaret,
Queen of England, her aunt:</p>

for peace. Such was my love of the
Whites, that those of my own country pointed
at me as I went by, and said, Logan is the
friend of white men! I had even thought to
live with you, but the iniquities of one among
you did away that thought, and dragged me
from my cabin of peace. Colonel Cressop the
last spring, in cold blood, cut off all the relations

<h3 id="131The" class="sidenote">The Emperor
and
the Opera
Dancer.</h3>

<p><span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">he</span> insurrection and popular tumult which
took place during the first days of the
reign of the present Emperor of Russia, Nicolas,
are facts well known; yet it may not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
uninteresting to relate some of the circumstances
attending the substitution of the Grand
Duke Nicolas Paulowitsch in place of his brother
the Grand Duke Constantine, who had
abdicated, as was declared, and renounced his
right to the crown in consequence of the marriage
which had been in opposition, it was
stated, to the opinions of his family, and by
them averred, with his own abdication of his
rights in favour of his brother Nicolas. After
the, to say the least, awfully mysterious death
of Alexander, the Archduke Constantine’s abdication
was thus explained.</p>

<p class="indent">It was towards the end of 1825 that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Petersburg was the scene of the struggle between
the subjects and the sovereign; marked,
in the first instance, by the fearless and intrepid
exposure of his own royal person, and in the
latter, by the terrible vengeance and inflictions
with which many of the agents of this revolt
were made to suffer by the merciless decree of
the new Emperor. Even where life was spared,
scarcely preferable to death were the punishments
awarded indiscriminately, and without
mitigation to age, youth, or sex.</p>

<p class="indent">Amongst the nobler victims of the Autocrat’s
implacable revenge, was the Prince Troubeitzkoi,
a young colonel, but lately married to the
daughter of one of the most distinguished members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
of the diplomacy at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg. This
unfortunate man had sought a refuge in the
house of his father in law; but his retreat being
discovered to Nicolas, he was pursued, and
with the trembling ambassador carried before
the Emperor. The Prince Troubeitzkoi,
throwing himself on his knees, implored his
clemency, and in tears the wretched parent
pleaded his youth and the sincerity of his repentance.
Disdaining to reply to the prostrate
nobleman, Nicolas turned to the ambassador,
saying that, in consideration for him, the life of
his son in law was granted, but that his name
would be added to those who were sentenced
to the <em>second</em> degree of punishment.</p>

<p class="indent">“To lay their head on the block whilst
reeking with the blood of their accomplices,
and afterwards to hard labour for life, in exile:
that exile, Siberia!”</p>

<p class="indent">Before relating the fate of any of the other
conspirators, we will add to the sad story of
this young couple, that the wife sued for and
obtained leave to follow her husband into
banishment; she nobly shared his trials, his
privations, and his labours in the mines. Her
devotion had no limit; and it was by the trifling
produce of her industry that she sustained her
family. Five times, in these desolate regions,
she became a mother. In the year 1838, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
gave her husband a fresh proof of her sublime
and unwearying affection. She quitted Siberia,
and alone crossing the dreadful country, after a
journey of <em>sixteen hundred leagues</em>, she threw
herself at the feet of the Emperor, and implored
his pardon for her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">The autocrat was inflexible, and forbade the
name of the individual who had dared to conspire
against his person, to be mentioned in his
presence.</p>

<p class="indent">The wretched wife withdrew, and again retrod
the desert path to exile and her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">Four years subsequently, this hapless victim
again resolved to undertake this dreadful journey,
and to make another effort to soften the
iron will of her sovereign. And this time she
succeeded, through the influence of—<em>an opera
dancer!</em></p>
<p class="center spaced-out"> * * * *</p>

<p class="indent">Marie Taglioni had by her talent, and her
good qualities, acquired the favour and indulgence
of the Emperor and the Empress. Whilst
none dared to speak in behalf of the miserable
exiles, or to utter the suppliant’s cry for mercy,
it was suggested, that probably Marie Taglioni
would venture to lay the petition at the Sovereign’s
feet; she did so, and, aided by the noble
intercession of the Empress, the pardon was
obtained; and after sixteen years banishment
the Prince Troubeitzkoï was released, but on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>

<p>“<span class="first">C</span><span class="looks_big">romwell</span> was formed to delude the
minds of men. His hypocrisy, a thing
far removed from what is ordinarily known by
that name, was fervent, and excited sympathy,
and created awe in the beholders. The bluntness
of his manner, and the occasional familiarity
of his deportment, even to the entire emptying
himself of all extrinsic and accidental greatness,
won the favour of those with whom he had intercourse.
There was something deep in his
conceptions, that none of his assistants could
fathom. He was moderate in his temper, and
forbearing in his actions; never allowing himself
in violence more frequently, or to a greater
extent, than was necessary to his purposes.
Add to which the firmness and courage of his
spirit, and the greatness of his abilities, whether
to procure intelligence, or to overawe the insidiousness
and crooked hostility of foreign courts:
and we shall own that he was most singularly
fitted for the station he filled.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Hyder Ali
Khan.</p>

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">n</span> the following extract from the speech of
the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, on
the subject of the Nabob of Arcot’s debts, the
reader is led by all the enthusiasm of characteristic
feeling and the ornamental graces of
imagination which distinguished that orator, to
the contemplation of a great though savage
mind, which he so strongly paints as struggling
against the toils of oppressive power, and in
the operation of determined revenge, <em>collecting,
calculating, and measuring</em> the vengeance with
which he purposed to visit his oppressors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span></p>

<p class="indent">“When at length Hyder Ali found that he
had to do with men who either would sign no
convention, or whom no treaty and no signature
could bind, and who were the determined enemies
of human intercourse itself, he decreed to
make the country possessed by these incorrigible
and predestinated criminals a memorable
example to mankind. He resolved, in the
gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such
things, to leave the whole Carnatick an everlasting
monument of vengeance, and to put
perpetual desolation as a barrier between him
and those against whom the faith which holds
the moral elements of the world together, was
no protection. He became at length so confident
of his force so collected in his might, that
he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful
resolution. Having terminated his disputes
with every enemy and every rival, who buried
their mutual animosities in their common detestation
against the creditors of the Nabob of
Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a
savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments
in the arts of destruction; and, compounding
all the materials of fury, havock, and desolation
into one black cloud, he hung for a while on
the declivities of the mountains. Whilst the
authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly
gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
all their horizon, it suddenly burst, and
poured down the whole of its contents upon
the plains of the Carnatick. Then ensued a
scene of woe, the like of which no eye had
seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue
can adequately tell. All the horrors of war,
before known or heard of, were mercy to that
new havock. A storm of universal fire blasted
every field, consumed every house, destroyed
every temple. The miserable inhabitants, flying
from their flaming villages, in part were slaughtered;
others, without regard to sex, to age, to
the respect of rank, or sacredness of function,
fathers torn from children, husbands from wives,
enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst
the goading spears of drivers and the trampling
of pursuing horses, were swept into captivity,
in an unknown and hostile land. Those who
were able to evade this tempest fled to the
walled cities; but, escaping from fire, sword,
and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.
The alms of the settlement, in this dreadful
exigency, were certainly liberal; and all was
done by charity that private charity could do;
but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation
which stretched out its hands for food. For
months together those creatures of sufferance,
whose very excess and luxury in their most
plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
of our austerest fasts, silent, patient, resigned,
without sedition or disturbance, almost without
complaint, perished by a hundred a day in the
streets of Madras. Every day seventy at least
laid their bodies in the streets, or on the glacis
of Tanjore, and expired of famine in the granary
of India. I was going to awake your
justice towards this unhappy part of our fellow
citizens, by bringing before you some of the
circumstances of this plague of hunger. Of all
the calamities which beset and waylay the life
of man, this comes the nearest to our heart,
and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels
himself to be nothing more than he is: but I
find myself unable to manage it with decorum;
these details are of a species of horror so nauseous
and disgusting, they are so degrading to
the sufferers and to the hearers, they are so
humiliating to human nature itself, that, on
better thoughts, I find it more advisable to
throw a pall over this hideous object, and to
leave it to your general conceptions. For
eighteen months, without intermission, this destruction
raged from the gates of Madras to
the gates of Tanjore; and so completely did
these masters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his
more ferocious son, absolve themselves of their
impious vow, that when the British armies
traversed, as they did, the Carnatick for hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
of miles in all directions, through the
whole line of their march they did not see one
man, not one woman, not one child, not one
four-footed beast of any description whatever.
One dead, uniform silence reigned over the
whole region. With the inconsiderable exceptions
of the narrow vicinage of some few forts,
(I wish to be understood as speaking literally;
I mean to produce to you more than three
witnesses, above all exception, who will support
this assertion in its full extent) that hurricane
of war passed through every part of the
central provinces of the Carnatick. Six or
seven districts to the North and to the South
(and these not wholly untouched) escaped the
general ravage.</p>

<h3 id="149Prid" class="sidenote">Pride of

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">t</span> is the present fashion to consider the pride
of descent as an empty pretension, but it
cannot be denied that it is a pretension which
has been regarded in every country, in all ages.
There are many sound philosophical arguments
in favour of a regard to birth, which pretenders
to deeper reasoning do not appear to be aware
of. It is a counteraction to the undue influence
of wealth and mere brutal power. It is impossible
to prevent the accumulation of wealth in
the basest of the people, at least in a free country!
The easiest paths to wealth are the
meanest and least virtuous. However, the
most current opinion is that <i>wealth is wealth</i>,
and that he who can spend the most is the most
important man; and that it is idle and childish
to pay any attention as to how and whence he
got it. But true aristocracy knows its own
place, and holds firm to it; and various are the
effects it has on the mind which cannot be
analysed by language. It has a tendency to
create a lofty sort of sentiment, rather than a
low and selfish gratification, as the guide of the
thoughts and the conduct. It would find a
thousand ideal comforts in adversity and obscurity,
which new families, thrown back into
poverty, cannot command.</p>

some time without having children, when this

thus born to be “a supposititious Prince of
Wales.” This tissue of forgery and falsehood
still farther tended to affect the popularity of
the king, and bring his person and throne into
disrepute. However, upon the whole mass
and evidence of history that is presented, the
only conclusion to be drawn was this, and only
this, that the Prince of Wales, so far from being
“supposititious,” was royally and legally born
the lawful successor of his father’s throne and

what he is by iniquity, and that what he possesses
was the inheritance of a long line of
flourishing ancestors,</p>

<p class="indent">Who, in those smiling days, when the intruders
of Great Britain were not heard of in the
fertile plains of Indostan, reaped their harvest
in quiet, and enjoyed their patrimony unmolested.</p>

<p class="indent">Think, oh! think, that the God whom
thou worshippest delighteth not in the blood of
the innocent; remember thy own commandment,
“<em>Thou shalt not kill</em>,” and obey the order
of Heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">Give me back my Almas Ali Cawn, and
take all our wealth.</p>

<p class="indent">Strip us of our jewels and precious stones, of
our gold and silver, but take not away the life
of my husband.</p>

<p class="indent">Innocence is sealed on his brow,</p>

<p class="indent">And the milk of human kindness flows round
his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us wander through the deserts, let us
become tillers and labourers on the delightful
spot of which he was once the master:</p>

<p class="indent">But spare, oh! mighty Sir, spare his life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Let not the instrument of death be lifted
against him, for he has committed <em>no crime</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">Accept those treasures from gratitude, which
at present thou takest by force; we will remember
thee in our prayer, and forget we were
once rich and powerful.</p>

<p class="indent">My children, the children of my Almas Ali,
send up their petitions for the life of him who
gave them life.</p>

<p class="indent">They beseech from thee the author of their
existence.</p>

<p class="indent">By that humanity we are told glows in the
breasts of Europeans;</p>

<p class="indent">By the tender mercy of enlightened souls of
Englishmen;</p>

<p class="indent">By the honour, virtue, and maternal affection
of thy great Queen,</p>

<p class="indent">Whose numerous offspring are so dear to
her; the miserable wife of thy prisoner beseeches
thee to save her husband’s life, and
restore him to her arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Thy God will reward thee:</p>

<p><em>They</em> will thank thee:</p>

<p class="indent">And the now petitioning, will pray for thee,
if thou grantest the prayer of thy humble

he killed no less than 440 of the enemy with
his own hand), and also conquered Norway,
Sweden, the principal part of France, was
crowned at Paris. On his return home in
great splendour, a vast concourse of foreign
princes and valiant knights flocked from all
parts of the world to his court; the king, unwilling
to create controversies amongst his
noble guests, by seeming to give precedence to
one more than another, caused an immense
round table to be erected in the great hall at
Winchester, where he then held his court, at
which it was so managed that no person could
take place of another. He selected a fraternity
of four and twenty, and elected it into an
order of knighthood, dignifying the knights
whom he chose companions with the title of
“Knights of King Arthur’s round table,” himself
to be their chief. These princely meetings

<p><span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">hose</span> ingenious gentlemen, the metaphysicians,
who have enlightened the
world by explaining away the fundamental doctrines
of religion, and the principles of human
actions and convictions, among other startling
discoveries, have introduced a theory on good
and evil actions, exceedingly applicable, comfortable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
and welcome to all mankind; as it
does away with conscience and duty, and makes
virtue and vice affairs of physical temperament
or organization—in other words, that a man’s
merit or demerit is not, as they hold, to be estimated
by his deeds, but by the amount of inclination
with which he commits them. Men,
according to those philosophers, are born with
particular inclinations, which lead them insensibly
and directly to particular vices or virtues,
or, with some peculiar organizations, to all the
vices or all the virtues. By this reasoning it
appears that it is as difficult for one man to
commit a certain crime, as for another to forbear;
and, as a natural consequence, that since
a man is not accountable for his inclination,
the guilt incurred by committing it, is of very
unequal account; and that if a man be not
praiseworthy for abstaining from a crime towards
which he has no inclination, neither is a man
blameable for committing it, if he is strongly
inclined to it. Nature, not man, ought to be
blamed or commended; and the being able to
lay the sin of vice or crime to the account of
organization, will materially facilitate the completion
of it.</p>

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">n</span> the year 1657, these walls (Fontainebleau)
were polluted by a crime which had no
parallel in the records of modern times. The
murder of Monaldeschi, and all its particulars,
as related so naïvely by Le Père Lobel, are too
well known to make it necessary to detail them:
but the letter that the haughty Christina wrote
to the minister Mazarin, when the king’s displeasure
was signified by him to her, is less
frequently quoted. It is a masterpiece of effrontery
and insolence; yet, a fortnight after receiving
it, both the king and cardinal paid a
solemn visit of reconciliation to the royal murderess.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<h4><i>Letter of Christina, Queen of Sweden to
Cardinal Mazarin.</i></h4>

<p class="indent">“Monsieur Mazarin,</p>

<p>“Those who have detailed to you the affair of
Monaldeschi, my equerry, were very ill-informed.
I think it strange that you should
compromise so many people in order to inform
yourself of a fact which does not concern you.
I ought not to be astonished at your conduct,
however absurd it may be; but I could have
scarcely credited, that either you or your proud
young master, would have dared to exhibit
towards me any marks of resentment.</p>

<p class="indent">“Learn, all of you, valets and masters, great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
and little, that it was my pleasure to act as I
have done: and that I neither am obliged, nor
will render an account of my actions to anybody,
be they who they may; above all, to a <i>braggadocio</i>
like you. You give yourself singular airs
for a personage of your rank; but whatever
reasons you may have had to write to me, I do
not care enough about them to concern myself
on the subject for a single instant. I desire
you to know, and to repeat it to whomsoever
it may concern, that Christina is totally indifferent
to the opinion of your court, and still less
to yours; that I have no occasion, in order to
compass my own vengeance, to have recourse
to your formidable power.</p>

<p class="indent">“My honour required what was done; my
will is a law which it is your part to respect:
to be silent is your duty; and there are many
persons for whom I have no more regard than
for yourself, who would do well to learn how
to conduct themselves towards their equals,
before they venture to make more disturbances
than is requisite.</p>

<p class="indent">“Know further, Monsieur le Cardinal, that
Christina is a Queen, wherever she may chance
to reside; and in whatever place it is her pleasure
to live, the persons who surround her,
cheats, though they may be, are better than you
and your confederates. The Prince de Condé<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
was right, when he exclaimed, at the time when
you kept him prisoner so inhumanly, at Vincennes,
‘This old fox will never cease to outrage
all the good friends of the state, until, at
last, the parliament shall turn off, or severely
punish, this illustrious rascal of <i>Piscena</i>.’ Take
my advice then, Jules; conduct yourself in a
manner to merit my favour; it is a study to
which you cannot too much apply. God preserve
you from ever daring to utter the least
word against me; for, were I at the other end
of the world, I should be aware of your proceedings.
I have friends and courtiers in my
service, who are as adroit and as watchful as
any you can boast of, although they may not be
so well bribed.”</p>

<p><span class="first">W</span><span class="looks_big">hen</span> Frederick the Great was forming
his Regiment of Royal Guards, it is
said, that the monarch was so anxious to obtain
tall men, that his corporals often took them by
force, wherever they could find them. On
one occasion they carried the wish of their
sovereign so far, that they took the “heyduc”
of the French ambassador, the moment he had
quitted his carriage to attend the levee. However,
on a complaint from the ambassador, the
servant was restored to his master.</p>

<p class="indent">It is also related of this ambassador, that on
his first audience he came highly perfumed;
the great Frederick, who was more accustomed
to the smell of gunpowder than of musk, could
not refrain from very visibly showing his dislike.
The ambassador observed it, and felt
much embarrassed. The day being stormy,
“De quel côté, sa Majesté croit-elle,” said he,
“que le vent vient?” The king abruptly replied,
“De France, votre Excellence.”</p>

the <em>gracious welcome</em> of Francis <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> to
return to Italy almost immediately, where he
was imprisoned in the castle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Angelo. By
the generous intervention of Francis, he was at
length released, and returned to France, where
he was most royally provided for; nevertheless,
his pride, and jealousy of Primatice, kept him
in constant agitation, and at length wearied out
the king, whose inclination was always obliged
to yield to his caprice; and at last he abandoned
the greatest advantages which ever were
offered to an artist, and quitted France for ever—a
step he never ceased to regret. On one
occasion, he went to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germains with a
vase of silver-gilt, destined for the Duchesse
d’Etampes, and was so irritated at the loss of
time which he was obliged to submit to before
he could be admitted to her presence, that he
hurried away, and in the height of his indignation
offered the vase to the Cardinal de Lorraine
as a present.</p>

<p class="indent">Another instance of his furious temper is
sufficiently remarkable. He tells, in his confessions,
that one of his models, a beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>

for thirty sous a day, having offended him,
“Giving way entirely to my rage, I seized her
by the hair, and dragged her about the room,
<em>kicking and beating her till I was quite fatigued</em>.
She swore she never would come near me
again; but the next morning at day-break, she
came, threw herself on my neck, covered me
with kisses, and asked if <em>I was still angry with
her</em>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">he</span> house of Medici,” says the author
of the Discours merveilleux sur la Vie
de Catherine de Medici, “was for a long period
hidden amongst the lowest refuse of the people
at Florence. It began to rise by means of a
collier, who had a son an apothecary, <em>who took
the name of his profession</em>; and as we in the
present day see people taking for devices the
emblems of their trade, as tailors their scissors,
masons their hammer or trowel, so this doctor
adopted <em>five pills</em>, as it is their habit to order an
odd number to their patients.” This is a singular
derivation of the armorial bearings of this
celebrated house.</p>

<h3 id="182Mich" class="faux">Michael Angelo.</h3>
<p class="sidenote">Scenes
from the
Life of
Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">n</span> the year 1474, on Monday the 6th of
March, at four o’clock in the morning, was
born at the castle of Caprese, in the territory
of Areggo, Michael Angelo, son of Ludovico
de Lionardo de Buonarotti, Governor of Chiusi
and of Caprese, and descended from one of the
most ancient families of Tuscany.</p>

<p class="indent">Although at this period of Florentine history
commerce and trade were considered as most
honourable pursuits, and indeed to these were
ascribed the great power and riches of the state,
the father of the little Michael Angelo destined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
him for his own profession, and already
foresaw him a future Governor, nay Ambassador;
far from thinking that he was destined
to become what he contemptuously termed a
mason! But there is a destiny attached to the
life of celebrated men; and fate selected for
Michael, as his nurse, the wife of a stonemason,
and whilst the child throve under her
care, and grew strong and robust in the sun
and air, his infant hands, hardened by exposure,
grasped the chisel and the hammer, and his first
cries mingled with the harsh grating of the saw.</p>

<p class="indent">It was in vain that the proud parent sought
to dissuade the boy, and curb the only inclination
he manifested: even at school he contrived
to escape the vigilance of the master, and obtained
the notice of the artist Ghirlandajo, who
said of him, “He is a rising star, that will live
to eclipse the brightest planet now shining.”
He was even induced to seek Michael’s father,
and beseeching him not to oppose the manifest
vocation of his son, offered to take him as an
apprentice to his art. At this proposal, the
Podesta started from his chair in a paroxysm of
rage; but after a while he calmly went to a desk,
wrote an engagement on the behalf of his son
for three years, and with an expression of
countenance little less affecting than that with
which Brutus signed the death warrant of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
son, handed him over to Ghirlandajo. With
one bound Michael cleared the staircase, throwing
up his cap for joy. He burnt his grammar:
true, he was not much more than a servant at
Ghirlandajo’s; but what did that matter? he
was free to pursue his own tastes, he was happier
than a Medicis! He could now bedaub
the walls as he chose, he could grind his colours,
sketch, or if a morsel of plaster fell in his way,
he could mould it to his will, without fearing
to have his ears pulled.</p>

<p class="indent">Before he had attained the age of thirteen,
he was already a great artist, and his success
had naturally created jealousy and enmity. A
blow from Torregiano, when they as boys
worked together, broke the cartilage of the
nose, and disfigured that feature for life.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, Michael Angelo could
not fail to find as many friends, and amongst
the most celebrated of the age. Benvenuto
Cellini, whose great genius and talents ranked
with those of Buonarotti, was his most ardent
admirer, and never designated him but as the
“divine Buonarotti.”</p>

<p class="indent">During the <em>boy</em> artist’s wanderings in the gardens
of the Medici palace, he often met some
of the stone cutters who had formerly rocked
his cradle: they were ever delighted to see
him, and frequently obtained him clandestinely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
a view of the treasures of the gallery, then in
its infancy. Michael Angelo contemplated
with veneration the mutilated specimens of art.
The workmen one day offered him a bit of
marble, requesting he would employ it as he
liked, and come thither as often as he chose.</p>

<p class="indent">His only answer was to grasp a chisel, throw
off his jacket, and begin to hammer out the
outline of a Faun’s head. Often then was the
workshop deserted, to the great displeasure of
the master. One day, whilst putting the finishing
strokes to his old Faun, a man about forty
years of age, plain in person and shabbily attired,
stopped, and silently watched him as he
worked. Michael Angelo continued to work
on, heeding him no more than the dust which
fell from his chisel. When he had given the
last touch, he drew back, as artists are wont, to
look on the effect of the head. For this, probably
the silent observer had waited, for he
slowly approached, and, putting his hand on
the young artist’s shoulder, “My friend,” he
said smiling, “with your leave, I would make
an observation.”</p>

<p class="indent">Michael Angelo turned quickly, and with an
air somewhat impertinent and caustic, replied,
“An observation!—you!”</p>

<p class="indent">“A criticism, if you prefer it.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Upon my Faun’s head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span></p>

<p class="indent">“Upon your Faun’s head.”</p>

<p class="indent">“And, who are you, Sir, who fancy you
have a right to criticise my work?”</p>

<p class="indent">“It matters not to you who I am, provided
my criticism is just.”</p>

<p class="indent">“And who will decide, Sir, which of us
two is in the right?”</p>

<p class="indent">“I will leave the decision to yourself.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Well, Sir, speak,” said Michael Angelo,
crossing his arms with an air of defiance.</p>

<p class="indent">“Was it not your object to make an <em>old</em>
Faun laughing immoderately?”</p>

<p class="indent">“Undoubtedly, it is easy to be discovered.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Well then,” said the critic, “where did
you ever see old men with all their teeth perfect?”</p>

<p class="indent">The boy blushed to his eyes, and bit his lip.
The observation was correct. He only waited
till the individual had turned his back, when
with one stroke of his chisel he knocked out
two of the Faun’s teeth, and even decided on
hollowing out the gum on returning next day.
The gardens accordingly were no sooner opened
than Michael Angelo entered; but the Faun
had disappeared, and in its place stood the person
he had seen the preceding day.</p>

<p class="indent">“What is become of my head?” asked the
young sculptor angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">“It has been removed by my command,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
replied the stranger, with his accustomed apathy.</p>

<p class="indent">“And who are you, Sir, who dare to give
orders in the gardens of the great Medicis?”</p>

<p class="indent">“Follow me, and you shall learn!”</p>

<p class="indent">“I will follow, to force you to restore me
my Faun.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Perhaps you will be better satisfied to leave
it where it is.”</p>

<p class="indent">“We shall see.”</p>

<p class="indent">“We shall see,” echoed the stranger, and
then took the path to the palace, with the same
calm demeanour; but on his beginning to ascend
the staircase, the boy, seemingly terrified as well
as angry, caught his arm, saying, “Where are
you going, Sir? You are approaching the
apartments of the Prince, and although he may
look over an intrusion in the royal gardens, we
here run great risk.”</p>

<p class="indent">On, proceeded the stranger, the servants
rising as he approached, the guards saluting.</p>

<p class="indent">Michael was lost in wonder. Even supposing
him one of the household (he thought
to himself), my Faun belongs to me, and he
ought to restore it: my labour is my own, and
I can pay him for the marble.</p>

<p class="indent">The galleries, the saloons were passed through
without interruption. Good Heaven! thought
the boy, it must be at least the secretary, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
I have thus cavalierly treated.</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger threw open the door of a room
magnificently furnished, and enriched with all
most valuable in art; and the trembling child
considered himself as lost, when he remembered
his treatment of one powerful enough to be
able to approach Lorenzo de Medicis without
being announced. Whilst he was stammering
out an apology, he raised his eyes, and saw his
old Faun placed on a superb bracket.</p>

<p class="indent">“You see, my friend,” said the stranger,
with the same mild and kind manner, “that if
I had your Faun removed from the garden, it
was to place it in a more suitable situation.”</p>

<p class="indent">“But, my God!” cried the youthful artist,
“what will the Prince say, when he discovers
this poor attempt amongst so many precious
works?”</p>

<p class="indent">The Prince held out his hand, “Take it,
my friend.”</p>

<p class="indent">Any other than Michael Angelo would have
thrown himself at his feet; but he burst into
tears, and, bowing his head, convulsively pressed
the hand offered him by Lorenzo the Magnificent.
“Henceforward thou art here at home,
my friend; thou wilt work here, dine at my
table, and I shall treat you as one of my children.
Go to my wardrobe, and desire that they
give thee a rich cloak of velvet; velvet, exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
like those worn by Peter and John de Medicis,
on days of ceremony.”</p>

<p class="indent">“My Lord,” replied the boy, deeply affected,
“suffer me first to go to my father, that he may
share my happiness. He turned me from his
roof as a disobedient and worthless child, and
I would return thither a submissive and devoted
man. I know my father to be as just as he is
inflexible, and he will admit that I have a right
to be proud of my disobedience. From this
day I may carry my head high; for Lorenzo de
Medicis, the first man of the age, has consecrated
me an artist.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Right, my child; and you may also tell
your father, that my patronage will extend to
all your family. This very day I will receive
him at the palace, and bestow on him any appointment
in Florence that may be suited to
him.”</p>

<p class="indent">Old Buonarotti was quietly breakfasting in his
room, which he had scarcely left since he had
lost his son, when loud and repeated knocking
at the door nearly drove it from its hinges.
The Governor hastened to open it himself, but
drew back at the sight of Michael Angelo, whom
he did not immediately recognize.</p>

<p class="indent">Pale, breathless, his head bare, his dress in
disorder, covered with dust and plaster, the
boy made a spring from the door to throw himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
into his father’s arms.</p>

<p class="indent">“Begone!” cried the Governor, trembling
with passion.</p>

<p class="indent">“Father, father, hear me, I implore, before
you thus drive me from you. Listen to me
but for one moment.”</p>

<p class="indent">“You would then force me to curse you.”</p>

<p class="indent">“I come from the palace.”</p>

<p class="indent">“I neither wish to know whence you come,
or what you do. I had once a son called
Michael Angelo. He was to have been (at
least, I hoped so) the glory, the support of my
family, the joy, the comfort of my old age, but
I have lost this ungrateful and disobedient son—thank
God, he is no longer here, I sold him
to the sculptor Ghirlandajo for eighteen florins.”</p>

<p class="indent">“For my mother’s sake, hear me! behold
me at your feet.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Back to your mason’s, that is your place.”</p>

<p class="indent">“My place!” said Michael Angelo, rising
proudly from his knees, “<em>my</em> place is in the
apartment of princes; my place is amongst the
first artists of Florence; my place is at the
table of Lorenzo the Magnificent.”</p>

<p class="indent">“My God, my God, he is mad!” exclaimed
the poor father, passing from rage to terror.</p>

<p class="indent">“But follow me, father, follow me, and you
will see that the great Lorenzo has taken me
by the hand, that he has placed me in his palace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
that he expects you, that he offers you an employment,
according to your choice.”</p>

<p class="indent">The old Buonarotti was perfectly upset; he
held his head between his hands, and asked of
himself which had lost his reason, his son or
himself. Michael Angelo not allowing him
farther time for reflection, dragged him by force
to the palace of the great Medicis. The Governor
believed himself to be in a dream. No
guard forbade their approach, and the courtiers
drew respectfully back to give them passage.</p>

<p class="indent">At the door of the Prince’s closet, a page
raised the hanging curtain, and the old Buonarotti
stood with his son in the presence of the
Medicis.</p>

<p class="indent">“Sir,” said the Prince, coming forward and
courteously addressing him, “I have been the
cause of disturbing you, in order to ask your
leave that I may retain about me a son of
whom you may be justly proud, and who bids
fair to become the first artist of his time. My
house shall be his home, and his salary you
will yourself name.</p>

<p class="indent">“In return, I make you only one request;
your son has probably already told you what.
It is that you ask of me any appointment most
suitable to your taste and habits. It is granted
beforehand.”</p>

<p class="indent">“My son,” replied the agitated father, endeavouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
to master his emotion, “will, I
think, be paid beyond his deserts, if he receives
five ducats monthly.”</p>

<p class="indent">“And for yourself, Sir?”</p>

<p class="indent">“For myself, Prince, I ask a trifling situation
now vacant in the customs: it can only
be given to a citizen of the State; I ask it, because
it is a post I feel I can fill with honour.”</p>

<p class="indent">“You will never be rich, my dear Buonarotti,”
laughingly replied the Medicis, “for,
offered any situation you please, you content
yourself with a little place in the customs.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Enough too—for the father of a <em>mason</em>!”</p>

<p class="indent">And thus was Michael Angelo de Buonarotti
introduced to the patronage of the illustrious
Medicis.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Of Bees.</p>

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">t</span> is easy to imagine why they are highly
valued. They have always been very numerous
in Palestine. Frequent mention is
made in the sacred volume of “honey out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the rock.” The Scriptures also speak of honey
as forming a part of the presents which it was
usual to send to persons of distinction. Canaan
is described as a land “flowing with milk and
honey.” John the Baptist is said to have lived
upon “locusts and wild honey,” and among
the articles of food set before our Saviour, when,
after his resurrection he ate with his disciples,
was a piece of an “honeycomb.”</p>

<p class="indent">These combined circumstances have doubtless
had their share in leading the uninstructed,
in nearly all countries and times, to look upon
the Bee with a feeling of superstitious reverence.</p>

<p><em>Mead</em>, the produce of the Bee, was the
favourite drink, the nectar of the ancient Britons;
and their attachment to this extraordinary
little insect ascended to a very remote
period. According to their belief, the high
origin of the Bee is from Paradise, and it was
on account of man’s transgression they left it,
and then God gave them a blessing. The
priests therefore maintained that no <em>Mass</em> ought
to be celebrated, except by the light of <em>wax</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">These extraordinary little insects make the
tops and bottoms of their cells of three planes
meeting in a point, and the inclinations or angles
at which they meet, are precisely those found
out by the mathematicians to be the best possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
for saving wax and work. Who could
dream the Bee was conversant with the highest
branch of the mathematics, the fruit of Newton’s
most wonderful labour, of the source
of which he was himself ignorant; one of his
most celebrated followers having found it out
in a later age? This little insect works with a
truth and correctness which are perfect, and
according to the principles at which man has
arrived only after ages of slow improvement in
the most difficult branch of the most difficult
science. But the mighty and all-wise Creator
who made the insect and the philosopher, bestowing
reason on the latter, and giving skill to
the former to work without it, to Him all
truths are known from all eternity with an intuition
that mocks even the conceptions of the
sagest of human kind.</p>

decollation of King Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> his body was
placed in a room at Whitehall, and that the
Earl of Southampton sat in the room to guard
and manifest his respect to the royal corse.
About midnight the door opened, and a person
so muffled that he could not be known entered;
who, after slowly walking to the coffin, looked
at the corse some time, and having exclaimed
“Cruel necessity!” as slowly retired. Lord
Southampton imagined from the figure and

<p class="indent" lang="fr">Enfin, Sainte-Foix, qui cherche à prouver
que le Masque de Fer n’était autre que le Duc
de Monmouth, cite un passage d’un ouvrage
par Pyms, et dans lequel on dit, “Le Comte
Danby envoya chercher le Colonel Skelton,
qui avait eu ci-devant la Lieutenance de la

l’avait otée pour la donner au Lord Lucas.
‘Skelton,’ lui dit le Comte Danby, ‘hier au

et enfermé dans quelque chateau en Angleterre.’
‘Je n’ai point affirmé cela, puisque je n’en

with that threatening hand hung
over us, and not think of it always! How
difficult it is to realise death! how difficult to
believe that the hand with whose every vein
you are familiar will ever lose its motion and
warmth! That the quick eye will settle and
grow dull. It is at first hard to believe that
we <em>must die</em>; harder still to believe the repulsive
circumstances that follow this terrible
change! It is a bitter thought, at the lightest.
There is little comfort in knowing that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
sense and the mind, that feel and measure suffering,
will be gone. The separation of soul
and body is too great a mystery to satisfy fear:
it is the body that we know; it is this material
frame in which the affections have grown up.
The spirit is a thought, a presence, that we
are told of, but do not see. The idea of existence
is connected indissolubly with the visible
body, and its pleasant and familiar scenes. We
talk of, and rest our belief on the soul’s ascent
to its Maker; but it is not ourselves, it is not
our own conscious breathing identity, that we,
in imagination, send up through the invisible
air; we do not understand, we cannot realise the
wondrous thought.</p>

<p><span class="first">D</span><span class="looks_big">uring</span> the government of the Anglo-Saxons
<em>Earldoms</em> of counties were not
merely dignities of honour, but officers of justice;
each person having the charge and custody
of the county of which he was Earl; and
for their assistance in the discharge of this duty,
they had also deputies, or <em>vicecomes</em>, as they
were denominated, appointed, which office still
continues to be executed by the Sheriffs annually
chosen for the different counties of England
and Wales. The <em>Earls</em>, in recompense for
their travelling expenses, and other charges incidental
to the affairs of this important office,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
had originally a salary derived from the profits
of the third penny of the county<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> granted to
them; and this custom continued for a long
time after the conquest, and was formerly inserted
as a princely benevolence in their patents
of creation. These salaries were at a later
period changed into pensions for the better
support of their dignity, as appears by many
ancient records. The word Earl, by the Saxons
was called <em lang="ang">Erlig</em>, or <span lang="ang">Ethling</span>; by the Germans,
<em lang="de">Grave</em>, as Landgrave, Margrave, &amp;c. and by
the Dutch, Eorle: but upon the conquest of
England by William, Duke of Normandy, in
1066, and the subsequent settlement of the
Normans in this country they were called
<em>Comes</em>, or <em>Comites</em>, and for consequence in State
affairs were usually styled <em>Comes Illustres</em>. Formerly
Kings were addressed by the title of
<em>Your Grace</em>. Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> was the first, says
Houssaie, who assumed the title of <em>Highness</em>;
and at length <em>Majesty</em>. It was Francis <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> who
began to give him this last title, in their interview
in the year 1520.</p>

Besides, it never did, never can exist! Were it
possible our lips could deny this truth, our
hearts must witness to it; and however strongly
the wretched atheist would assert the nonexistence
of the power he denies, the very
faculties, the reasoning, the subtle arguments
which he employs, are these not so many attributes
derived from a power, Almighty, though
indefinite, Omnipresent, though invisible? The
command of language, the superiority of talent

system; whilst common sense declares beyond
all doubt, the existence of that wonderful chain
of creation, of which man is the first link,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
formed by a Divine intelligence, foreseeing and
pre-ordaining all things. Alas! it must be admitted,
that Voltaire denied the <em>Divinity</em> of
our Saviour, although his virtues were those of
a Christian; so often evinced in acts of the
purest benevolence and philanthropy, rejecting
all sectarian intolerance, affecting no uncharitable
jargon. How to be regretted that such
virtues were not guided and supported by belief!</p>

illimitable being; who see in virtue the essence
of the element of that world they are to inhabit,
and to which they but accustom themselves
betimes; who comfort their weariness amidst
the storms of time, by seeing far across the
melancholy seas the haven they will reach at
last; who deem that every struggle has its
assured reward, and every sorrow its balm;

<p><span class="first">A</span><span class="looks_big">nne</span> Maurice was daughter of
Philippe <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> King of Spain, and of
Margarette of Austria; she was born at Valladolid,
on Saturday the 22nd of September,
1601; married to Louis <abbr title="the Thirteenth">XIII.</abbr> King of France,
called “the Just,” the 9th of November, 1615,
and not till after twenty-three years became a
mother, giving birth first to Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> and
next to Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans,
who married the Princess Henrietta of England,
daughter of the unfortunate Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
and of Henrietta sister of Louis <abbr title="the Thirteenth">XIII.</abbr> At the
death of this monarch, his son being only <em>nine</em>
years of age, he declared Anne of Austria
Regent, and during the period of her administration,
to that in which she surrendered the
direction of his kingdom, at the majority of
Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> she fully justified the election;
her great strength of mind and justice of conduct
never giving way, though intestine dissention
and foreign wars rendered her task not a
little arduous. More than once the Queen
Regent abandoned her capital during the tumult
of the parliamentary faction, supported by the
Duke of Orléans,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the late King’s brother.
The spirit of discontent gave the ministry of
Cardinal Mazarin as its source, but it was long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
before the Queen would yield her predilection
for, and support of this minister. His eventual
exile restored peace at home, but it was not of
long duration, and the Cardinal returned to negotiate
the marriage of his sovereign with the
Infanta of Spain, niece to the Queen Regent.
This amiable Princess was not only chosen by
Anne of Austria as the means of restoring
peace between Spain and France, but also as
interesting to her by the ties of maternal affection,
being her brother’s daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Till the death of Mazarin, Louis was little
conspicuous in the administration of his government,
and so much had he felt the evil consequence
of the authority and patronage assumed
by the Italian Cardinal, that he resolved to keep
the reins in future wholly in his own hands.
Mazarin had been brought forward by the
minister Richelieu, and raised from obscurity;
he died possessed of incalculable riches, after
having made the fortunes of all his family.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The anxious affection of the Queen for her
sons, was marked to the last hour of her life;
her watchful solicitude not only desired their
temporal grandeur but their moral conduct and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
eternal salvation, to which her prayers were
ever directed. She suffered much disquietude
from the dissipation of Louis, and though wisely
endeavouring to conceal or excuse his infidelities
in the eyes of the Queen, she remonstrated
with the King on several occasions with the
zeal of a Christian, and the love of a parent;
and though they failed of all the wished for
effect, the affection and duty of the King
steadily accompanied his mother to her grave.
Her patience and fortitude, during a lingering
and painful disease, could not be surpassed.
She died of a cancer in the breast at sixty-five
years of age; preserving, almost unimpaired, the
beauty which had rendered her in youth the
subject of universal admiration. Her attractions
made her as naturally the object of calumny
as of applause, for this is the tax they ever pay.
That she had many lovers is beyond doubt,
but whether she observed the rigid propriety of
conduct asserted by Mde. de Motteville, or
whether she was culpable of the indiscretions
ascribed to her by less partial authors, it is at
least certain that her virtues were <em>great</em>; and
if she had faults, the neglect of her husband at
the period when all Europe bent before her
perfections, gives an undisputed apology. The
cold and apathetic neglect of the gloomy Louis
afforded encouragement to less lawful admiration;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
and of the number of her suitors none
were more conspicuous than the accomplished
English Duke of Buckingham. Mons. Regnault
Warin does not scruple to make him the
father, and Anne of Austria the mother, of the
mysterious “Masque de Fer:” yet it is hardly
credible to human feeling, that a mother’s tenderness
could so far give way to state policy,
as to sanction the long and cruel imprisonment
of the being to whom she gave life but to be a
curse. Yet this contradiction exists in the
Memoires of the “Masque de Fer.”</p>

and of the minister De Richelieu of Anne of
Austria (though some pens declare this crafty
statesman to have been also the slave of her
charms), greatly strengthened the indifference
of the King towards his Queen: indeed, so
much was it considered a miracle when the
heir to the crown was born, that he was surnamed
the “Gift of God.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It was the King’s
own act to nominate the Queen, Regent, after
his death; and his confidence in her integrity
and wisdom was fully justified by her exercise
of this power. She was free from all spirit of
revenge, never seeking it, even of her worst
enemies; and this was greatly evinced in her
consideration of the Queen Mary of Médicis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
after she had incurred the displeasure of Louis
<abbr title="the Thirteenth">XIII.</abbr> as well as her kind reception of the persecuted
Queen of England, when driven for
refuge to the court of France. When Princess
of France, Henrietta had been often by the influence
of her mother, Mary de Médicis, guilty
of acts of unkindness to her brother’s Queen;
but this never appeared in the behaviour of the
latter towards the Queen of England, whose
sorrows she in every manner sought to alleviate,
and furnished her with money to send to her
captive husband, till the sad termination of his
fate. The Duchess of Orléans was only a few
days old when her royal brother fled from
England; and brought up in the family of the
French monarch, she was very dear to the
Queen Mother, and chosen by her as the wife
of her second son, afterwards Duke of Orléans.</p>

contraires à leurs traditions, qu’ils savent faire

<p class="sidenote">Origin of
the title of
“Sforza.”</p>

<p><span class="first">J</span><span class="looks_big">ames Sforza</span>, the father of Francis
the first Duke, was the founder of the
house of Sforza, which gave six Dukes to
Milan, and was allied with almost every sovereign
in Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. He was born in 1369, at
Catignuola, near Faenza; his father, according
to tradition, was a day labourer, and to others,
a shoemaker, but probably wrought as both.
Perceiving some soldiers pass, he was struck
with the desire of bearing arms. “I will go,”
said he to himself, “and dart my hatchet against
that tree, and if it stick fast in the wood I will
immediately become a soldier.” The hatchet
stuck fast, and because, says the Abbot of
Choisi, he threw the axe with all his force, he
assumed the supposed fortunate name of Sforza,
as his real name was Giacomuzzo, or James
Attendulo.</p>

bribe) the body of her husband; and herself,
laden with this dreadful but cherished burthen,
hastened to an isolated house which she occupied,
where, after bathing it with her tears, she
herself prepared the mutilated remains for the
grave, which she made with her own hands in
a secluded spot of the garden, solemnly and
carefully closing the earth over it. And on
that spot, soon as the stars brightened the
heavens, was this poor mourner to be seen,
like a phantom, clothed in deepest mourning,
kneeling on the grave till morning. One
winter’s night she came as usual, and knelt in
prayer. The snow fell fast, and hung on her

frame yielded to the blast, and she fell insensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>

about a hundred steps distant from the camp.
The night was far advanced, and the wretched

the same effect on the holy brotherhood. But
the case was seriously different; the unfortunate
fathers, who greedily made use of it, died
in a short time, and this is the origin of its
name, according to the pure French word. In
spite of this unfortunate beginning, <i>Paracelsus</i>
resolved to bring this mineral into practice;
and by mixing it with other preparations make
it useful. The Faculty at Paris were on this
occasion divided into two parties, the one maintained
that <em>Antimony</em> was a <em>poison</em>; the other
affirmed that it was an excellent <em>remedy</em>. The
dispute became more general, and the Parliament
and the College of the Sorbonne interfered
in the matter; but some time afterwards
people began to judge rightly concerning this
excellent mineral; and its wonderful and salutary
effects have occasioned the Faculty to
place it among their best medicines.</p>

<p>“<em lang="sco">God bless you; and may the field of battle
never leave your heart sair!</em>” It is
scarcely possible to imagine a more natural and
appropriate address <em>from</em> a soldier’s wife <em>to</em> a
soldier’s wife. This, was the spontaneous
effusion of grateful feeling, excited by some
little service which I had been the means of
rendering to a soldier of my husband’s regiment,
for which his wife came to thank me. It is
one of the many instances which I have met
of that species of <i>Ossianic</i> expression (if I may
be allowed the term) which distinguishes the
lower orders of the Scotch and Irish. I remember
an occurrence in the life of an unfortunate
friend of mine, which not only proves
how capable this class of people are of deep and
refined sentiment, but also of a strength and
pathos of language which loses nothing from
the simplicity of its guise. The lady to whom
I allude, had, under circumstances of very peculiar
misfortune, in which reason, nearly shaken
from its seat, had deprived her of all sense save
that of misery, been admitted to the shelter of
a cottage by the road side, in the neighbourhood
of D——, whose honest inhabitants
hastened to afford her the only comforts their
power admitted; their own bed, the warmth
of their peat fire, and a share of their humble
meal. They sought with kind solicitude, unmixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
with obtrusive curiosity, to learn the
causes which led to the sorrow they witnessed,
but finding every effort vain, they checked their
inquiries. “<span lang="sco">Puir thing! her heart’s crushed,
and her spirit broken</span>,” said the gudewife,
whilst she placed the poor wanderer’s head
upon her homely pillow, and then seated herself
with her old man by their turf fire and unclosed
the Bible, which with the Poems of Robert
Burns constituted their library.</p>

<p class="indent">The activity of friendship soon traced the
fugitive, but no arguments could induce those
benevolent beings to accept remuneration in
any form: nearly twelve months elapsed, when,
journeying south, their former inmate sought
the spot to which the “memory of the heart”
furnished the clue. The gudewife, with looks
of surprise, surveyed the handsome equipage
from whence the inquiry for herself and husband
was addressed, nor could she recognise,
even in the still faded form before her, the distracted
tenant of her lonely hut: on being
joined by the old man, mutual explanations
took place, and by dint of many arguments,
the little offerings that had been brought for
them were accepted by these good Samaritans,
as “<em lang="sco">kip sakes from the leddy, and nae for payment
of what it was sae natural to do for a puir
suffering fellow creter</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="first">T</span><span class="looks_big">he</span> Torpedo is found in the British Seas,
particularly at Torbay, near Waterford,
on the coast of Ireland. This extraordinary
fish likes to bury itself lightly in the sand, in
which situation the Torpedo gives its most forcible
shock, and throws down the astonished
passenger who inadvertently treads upon it.
On touching the fish with the fingers, it sometimes
happens that the person feels an unusual
painful numbness, which suddenly seizes the
arm up to the elbow, and sometimes to the
very shoulder and head. The pain is almost
indescribable, and bears some resemblance to
the sensation felt in the arm on striking the
elbow violently against a hard body. It is even
affirmed that it will benumb the astonished
fisherman through the whole length of the line
and rod.</p>

in air twenty-four hours, and but little longer
in water.</p>

address him, might so engross my feelings as
to render me, (in appearance,) unmindful of the

designating himself as a friend. At his death
I had not to regret only the loss of a sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
whose condescending kindness admitted the
petitioner to his presence, but also those
lengthened conversations in which were displayed
the brilliant emanations of his highly
cultivated mind, and the fruits of deep classical
research: or did I only lament the deprivation
of his royal bounties. I wept for the loss of
the beneficent being, whose heart had expanded
in sympathy to the sorrows of a widowed
mother, whose gracious recollections honoured
a father’s grave, and to whom in the hour of
trial I never appealed in vain. Would that
my words could do justice to the devoted veneration
my heart bears him! Wit and eloquence
were his to a supreme degree. None ever
possessed to a greater extent the talent of saying
that which was appropriate, kind, or conciliating.

<p lang="fr"><span class="first">E</span><span class="looks_big">ntre</span> Antioche et la ville de Tripoli,
à l’orient de Tortose, il y a une plaine,
dont l’étendue est de six milles de largeur, et
de douze milles de longueur. Elle est terminée
par des groupes de petites montagnes.
Ces montagnes étaient habitées autrefois par
un peuple qui se donnait le nom d’Arsacides,
prétendant être descendus du fameux Arsace,
fondateur de l’empire des Parthes, àpres la
mort d’Alexandre. Ce peuple sorti, vers le
septième siècle, des confins de Perse, vers Babylone
vint former un petit état dans un coin
de la Phénicie.—Ils s’y batirent des forteresses
sur des rochers inaccessibles, d’où ils se rendaient
redoutables à tous leurs voisins. Leurs brigandages
et leurs assassinats leur firent donner
le nom de <em>Buveurs de Sang</em>, qu’on changea
bientôt en celui d’<em>Assassin</em>, à cause de leur arme
favorite, le poignard, qu’on appelle en Persan
<i lang="fa">Hassisan</i>. Les Assassins élisaient eux-mêmes
leur chef; il se nommait <em>le Vieux de la Montagne</em>,
nom fameux dans les histoires de ce
temps-là. Il portait ce nom, soit parceque le
choix qu’on en faisait tombait toujours sur un
des plus anciens de la nation, soit parcequ’il
habitait un chateau nommé <i>Almeet</i>, ou <i>Alameet</i>,
situé sur une haute montagne inattaquable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Nos vieux historiens ont mal entendu l’Arabe:
<em>Scheik</em> signifie le plus <em>vieux</em>, <em>senior</em>; mais il signifie
aussi <em>Seigneur</em>. Il n’est pas vrai que les
Assassins choissient pour Prince le plus ancien
de la nation, il fallait donc traduire le <em>Seigneur</em> de
la <em>Montagne</em>. Son empire sur ses sujets était si
absolu, que fallait il commettre les actions les
plus noires, ils étaient toujours prêts à les exécuter
au premier signal qu’on leur faisait, et au
péril de leur propre vie. On les accuse de
l’assassinat de Louis de Bavière, en 1231, et
d’avoir osé attenter à la vie de Saint Louis. Il
parait étonnant qu’une si monstreuse tribu ait
pu se maintenir pendant près de quatre cents
ans: ce ne fut qu’en 1257 que les Tartares,
sous leur roi Allan, ou Haloan, pour délivrer
leur pays de si dangereux voisins entreprirent de
massacrer leur chef et de les détruire; ce qu’ils
exécutèrent.</p>

<p><span class="first">I</span><span class="looks_big">s</span> the bark of a tree found in the province of
Quito, in America. The tree is of a moderate
size; its leaves resemble those of a
plum-tree, but have no medicinal power, nor
has the wood. The gum which flows from
the tree, and the seed which it produces, are
equally efficacious in curing a fever with the
bark itself. The Americans discovered the
medicine in the year 1640. The properties of
the bark were made known to the various parts
of Europe by Cardinal de Lago and some other
Jesuits, and thence has been called Jesuit’s
Powder.</p>

<h3 id="253Crit"><i>Critique on David’s Picture of the Deluge.</i></h3>

<p>“A <span class="looks_big">modern</span> painter, certainly possessing
very great talent, has attempted a
picture of the Deluge. He has crowded into
it a great many horrors, all very horrible; but
the principal group will be sufficient.</p>

<p class="indent">“It consists of a family vainly endeavouring
to escape from the surrounding destruction by
climbing a rock in the foreground. The agonies
of such a moment might have been expressed
most touchingly, had the artist chosen
to keep within the bounds of moderation: but
no, he must out-Herod Herod; and consequently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
he has contrived to make one of the
most dreadful situations the human mind can
conceive actually ludicrous. The principal
figure is that of a man, who, like pious Æneas,
carries his father on his back, certainly not in
the most elegant or picturesque attitude possible,
while with one hand he pulls his wife up after
him rather unceremoniously. The wife, for
her part, suffers considerable inconvenience
from a young gentleman behind, who, having
a mortal aversion to being drowned, has got
his mother fast hold by the hair, by means of
which he almost pulls her head off her shoulders.
The whole family are certainly not very
comfortably situated, and in fact the old gentleman
who is riding on his son’s shoulders is the
only one at all at his ease, and he appears to
have a very good seat, and not to care much
about it. Yet I have heard this picture lauded
to the skies, both in France and England.”</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
