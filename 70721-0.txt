TO THE READER.


My “Cairn” is principally raised by the hands of many friends whose
honoured names are now with the dead, whose kind sympathies have
cheered my checquered existence, and whose intercourse has often
corrected and enlightened my mind, leading it to seek in occupation
a refuge from painful feeling. These contributions, together with
original thoughts, and the gleanings of my own reading, I presume to
offer to the public; with the hope that where criticism finds ample
cause to condemn, my acknowledged weakness may plead for indulgence.
Several pages bear the record of memories associated with those dear
to me, and of events long past. I presume to believe, that the perusal
of the “Cairn,” cannot injure, and may not fruitlessly occupy or amuse
an idle hour.

[Sidenote: Joy.]

Joy paints with its own colours every act and thought. The _happy_ do
not feel poverty, for delight is a gold tissued robe, and crowns them
with priceless gems. Enjoyment plays the cook to their homely fare,
and mingles intoxication with their simple drink. Joy strews the hard
couch with roses, and makes labour ease. Sorrow doubles the burthen to
the beaten down, plants thorns in the unyielding pillow, mingles gall
with water, adds saltness to their bitter bread, clothing them in rags
and strewing ashes on their bare heads. To our irremediable distress
every small and petty inconvenience comes with added force. We sink
beneath the additional feather chance throws on us; The grass-hopper is
a burthen.

[Sidenote: Purgatory.]

Anne of Austria, queen of Louis XIII. was extremely delicate in all
that concerned the care of her person; it was scarcely possible to find
lawn or cambric sufficiently fine for her use. Cardinal Mazarin used
to say that her punishment in purgatory would be, her being obliged to
sleep in Holland sheets!

[Sidenote: The recollection of a Mother.]

It is ever thus, whenever I am unhappy I bring distant and impossible
events together, I turn to the thought of you, my Mother, for comfort,
and I feel that _you are not_, that on earth you can never be again,
that all my grief, and all my love, multiplied a thousand fold, could
not recall you for one little hour; and I wish again for you, my
blessed Mother, as though but just snatched from me. Time, they say,
lessens grief. Yes, its constancy, not its intensity; it may give us
even long intervals of peace and happiness, but when grief does return,
it is strong and keen and deep as ever. How indeed can regret for such
a loss be lessened? Can the thought of a Mother’s love, such a love as
mine bore me, ever lose its charm, its influence? Not, I am sure, even
when the reality is lost; what it _was_ to me, so it _is_. Perishable
things alone lose their value. Time withers flowers, but does not dim
the diamond; and shall love for the being who gave us birth, the only
real emanation of the Deity, that burns within us, perish as a passion
of the earth? Can what is ethereal change its nature, as grosser
substances? the eternal become mortal, the infinite be bounded, and
what is born of the soul know death? Never!

[Sidenote: Anecdote of Cardinal d’Estrées.]

“Cæsar bishop of Laon and Cardinal d’Estrées, son of the first Marshall
of France of that name, was employed in various negotiations with the
Princes of Italy; but is now more remembered for his courtier-like
reply to Louis XIV. That Monarch one day at dinner complained of having
lost all his teeth. ‘And who is there, Sire, that has any teeth?’
said the Cardinal (Sire, qui est-ce qui a des dents?). What made the
flattery the more ludicrously gross was, that the Cardinal, though an
old man, had remarkably fine teeth and showed them very much whenever
he opened his mouth.”

Whereas Frances wife of the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Vane,

rest of her friends:--I do hereby promise to any person, or persons
who shall discover where the said Lady Vane[1] is concealed, to me, or
to Francis Harwes, Esq. her father, so that either of us may come to
the speech of her, the sum of £100, as a reward to be paid by me on
demand at my lodgings in Piccadilly. I do also promise, the name of the
person, who shall make such discovery shall be concealed if desired.
Any person concealing or lodging her after this advertisement shall
be prosecuted with the utmost rigour; or if her Ladyship will return
to me, she may depend upon being kindly received. She is about twenty
two years of age, tall, well shaped, has light brown hair, is fair
complexioned, and has her upper teeth placed in an irregular manner.
She had on when she absented a red damask French Lacque, and was
attended by a French woman who speaks very bad English.

[Sidenote: Delicacy of Feeling.]

The best parts of human qualities are the tenderness and delicacy of
feeling in little matters, the desire to soothe and please others, the
minutiæ of the social virtues. Some ridicule these feminine attributes,
which are left out of many men’s natures: but I have known the brave,
the intellectual, the eloquent possess these gentle qualities; the
braggart, the weak, never! Benevolence and feeling ennoble the most
trifling actions.

accustomed to, but living, breathing, bustling, plotting, planning,
human vulgarity, is a species of _moral ipecacuanha_, enough to destroy
any comfort.

When moralists, religionists, and philosophers of all sorts, set about
reasoning on the phenomena of the world we live in, and contemplating
the mass of human misery to be found therein, trace it to fearful
crimes, they overlook one little cause of suffering which blights
more happiness, and neutralises a greater portion of God’s bounteous
favours, than all the heinous enormities of our depraved race put
together. This hateful, stealthy, heart-destroying blight is often
found, where every thing like atrocious vice is utterly unknown, and
where many of the highest virtues flourish. All may exist, with a _sour
temper_!

obedience was imperative, but in erecting the statue of Louis the XIV.
they inscribed on the pedestal, “This is the grandson of our good
Henri.”[2]

Look at the career of Man, as he passes through the world; of Man,
visited by misfortune! How often is he left by his fellow man, to sink
under the weight of his afflictions, unheeded and alone! one friend
of his own sex forgets him, another neglects him, a third perhaps
betrays him; but woman, faithful woman, follows him in his misery with
unshaken affection; braves the changes of his feelings, of his temper,
embittered by the disappointments of the world, with the highest of all
the passive virtues; a resigned patience ministers to his wants, even
when her own are hard and pressing; weeps with him, “_tear for tear_,”
in his distress, and is the first to catch and to reflect a ray of joy,
should but one light up his languid countenance in the midst of his
sufferings: and never leave him to his misery, whilst there remains
one act of love, duty, or compassion to be performed. And at the last,
when life and sorrow cease together, follows him to the tomb with that
ardour of affection which death alone can destroy.

_The Musical Instruments._

[Sidenote: A Fable.]

    The Beaux and Belles were gone, the Concert o’er,
    And Kelly’s sprightly strains were heard no more;
    Thro’ the deserted room dead silence reign’d,
    And still and dumb each tuneful string remain’d;
    When from the case in which a Fiddle lay
    Arose a voice that said or seem’d to say:
      “Basses and Tenors, Kettledrums and Flutes,
    Trumpets, and Horns, Fiddles, Flageolets,
    From you that solemn groan to you that squeak,
    Patient attend and hear a brother speak:
    Oft have I mused with sorrow and regret,
    Since here confined I mourn’d my captive state,
    That tho’ from Harmony our being rose,
    We unconnected live, nor friends nor foes;
    Nor know society, till in the band
    We yield our music to the master’s hand;
    Those happy moments o’er, confined again,
    Silent and un-united we remain:
    Let us for mutual interest then combine;
    To each his different share of power assign;
    And from our choice that no dissension spring,
    Speak, all, and let the worthiest be our King,
    Under whose reign, by man when unemploy’d,
    Peace, harmony and bliss may be enjoy’d.”
      He spoke, thro’ all melodious accents ran,
    And the slow solemn Organ thus began:
      “Much I approve my four string’d brother’s scheme,
    And own it oft has been my silent theme,
    And since harmonic merit mounts the throne,
    I claim the royal title as my own.
    Observe me well when glorious here I stand,
    And with a look alone respect command.
    On me has man bestow’d his utmost care,
    And as he found me great he found me fair;
    My front with pipes of radiant gold array’d
    Above the painter’s utmost art display’d;
    This made a thousand instruments combine
    And all in one great, glorious whole conjoin:
    Nor do I boast of outward form alone,
    For Harmony has mark’d me as her own;
    Has taught my sweetly solemn sounds to flow
    In all the pomp and majesty of woe;
    Has taught my notes on seraph’s wings to fly,
    And raise the ravish’d soul above the sky;
    Has made in Heaven’s own that voice rever’d,
    And kings to kneel whenever it is heard.
    To whom then but to me shall pow’r be given,
    Who rule on earth and lead the way to heaven?”
      The Organ spoke majestically slow,
    And thus the brazen Trumpet ’gan to blow:
      “Were size enormous or were colours bright
    To strike the judgment as they strike the sight,
    The world’s great empire would disputed lie
    ’Twixt the huge whale and gilded butterfly;
    But the gay peacock vainly strives to sing,
    In vain the unwieldy ostrich spreads his wing,
    While music swells the homely linnet’s throat,
    And on the yielding air the little swallows float.
    I boast no beauty then, I boast no size,
    Since nought but merit true can gain the prize:
    If so, I boldly call that prize my own,
    And claim, whoe’er oppose that claim, the throne.
    If warlike feats, if deeds of high renown,
    Bravely perform’d, on men bestow the crown,
    Like right is mine, who still am heard afar,
    The dreadful harbinger of glorious war;
    At whose loud voice, heroic ardour springs
    In the bold hearts of heroes and of kings.
    With them where’er they go, I brave my fate,
    With them victorious share their royal state;
    Till men whene’er my glorious voice they hear,
    Know that a hero or a prince is near.
    Such are my claims, let me your ruler be,
    Receive a hero and a King in me.”
      He ended, and the silver sounding Flute
    Thus strove the boaster’s title to confute:
      “Brothers of Harmony, whose breathings move
    The human soul to virtue, peace, and love,
    Shall we be ruled by one whose dreadful breath
    Spreads thro’ the world division, discord, death?
    Let kings for fame forget their people’s good,
    And butchering heroes wade in harmless blood,
    While we endeavour, as by Heaven design’d,
    To soothe and not inflame the human mind.
    In the sweet shade, and by the silent stream,
    I softly sing, and peace and love my theme.
    To my gay notes, beneath the checker’d shade,
    Dance the blithe shepherd and the harmless maid.
    Far from destroying war or faithless courts
    I seek the scenes where innocence resorts,
    There have I learnt betimes, in virtue’s school,
    The _art_, do you bestow the _power_ to rule.”
      Soon as the gentle Flute had spoke his claim
    From every corner mingling murmurs came:
    With loud commanding note the Fiddle swore
    Ne’er was _his_ preference denied before;
    ’Twas he that still employed the master’s hand,
    Follow’d obsequious by the list’ning Band;
    Nay swore, that _Kelly_ learnt from him the art
    To rule with magic sounds the human heart!
    The Harpsichord, the fav’rite of the fair,
    Talk’d much of _them_, and plac’d his merits there.
    Clamour on clamour grew, each prais’d his own,
    And strove his neighbour’s merits to run down;
    Till frightened Harmony forsook the room,
    And crashing Discord shook the lofty dome;
    Up rose at last a chief of little _fame_,
    Yet mighty _use_, and _Pitch pipe_ was his name;
    In steady unison he thus began,
    While wonder thro’ the place in murmur ran:
      “Brethren of melody, to whom ’tis given
    By man, first taught the glorious art by Heaven,
    The various passions of the human soul,
    To raise, to soothe, to heighten, to controul;
    To thrill with softest sounds the lover’s heart,
    To raise his transports, or to soothe his smart;
    To cheer the sinking soul with liveliest air,
    To soften madness or to calm despair;
    To rule the thousand sympathies that bind,
    With strongest, sweetest ties, the human mind.
    Such are your powers while Harmony _shall_ reign,
    By her forsaken, all those powers are vain.
    His hallow’d notes in vain the Organ blows,
    The Fiddle’s tone with sweet expression glows;
    In vain the Flute soft blows his am’rous breath,
    The strepent Trumpet speaks the sounds of death;
    Vainly they strive to move the feeling soul,
    Till heaven-born Harmony conduct the whole.
    For _me_ one _note_ does all my power confine,
    Employ’d for others’ uses, not for mine;
    And yet, however small my compass be,
    Harmonic _Union_ you must owe to me;
    For still by me, whene’er you sound alone,
    Or mix in concerts, must be fix’d your _tone_.
    Then strive no more but fix on _me_ your choice,
    Who save from discord, strife, confusion, noise;
    So shall the powers of music matchless reign,
    Nor has divine Cecilia come from heaven in vain.”
      He said, and straight his tone, tho’ simple sound,
    Conviction follow’d, and himself was crown’d.
    ’Tis thus, my friend, that in the human soul
    The various movements _Reason_ should controul,
    While headlong sallies Prudence should restrain,
    And fancy yield to Judgment’s shady reign;
    If the kind muse poetic rage inspire,
    Or glows the breast with patriotic fire,
    If wit, that seldomer does good than harm
    ’Midst social scenes, shall teach the tongue to charm,
    If love with sweet sensations fills the mind,
    Or sacred friendship mutual bosoms bind,
    Howe’er with _genius_, _fancy_, _feeling_ blest,
    ’Tis Prudence must direct, or vain are all the rest.

It is recorded of the celebrated Sculptor Giovanni Lorenzi Bernini,

the other a half side, and the third a profile, the artist observed,
“whoever the individual be whose likeness these three portraits
represent, I am of opinion that the same will come to an untimely end.”

This painting had been expressly taken and forwarded to Rome in order
that Bernini might, from the resemblance, sculpture a marble bust of
the king; which accordingly he did, and King Charles, the best and
greatest patron of the arts that England can boast of, was so much
pleased with the performance, that he sent Bernini a very valuable
ring, saying to the person whom he commissioned to deliver it, “Andate
a coronar quello mano, che ha fatto si bel lavarno.”

loveliest, most disagreeable, best natured, cruelest woman in the world.

Of herself she writes, “I thank God I still retain my taste for the
gay part of reading. Wise people may think it trifling, but it serves
to sweeten life to me, and is at least better than the generality of
conversation.” I know by experience how far the love of reading is
capable of softening the cruelest accidents of life: even the happiest

easy as books, which if they do not give cheerfulness, at least restore
quiet to the most troubled mind.

Strange but beautiful is the strength of maternal affection. This

for, a mercy to be acknowledged with thankfulness--in the eyes of his
mother is one of hope and of interest as great as the most perfect. She
weeps not that he was born, but that he dies; weeps as passionately as
the parent who loses the most beautiful, the most gifted offspring:
perhaps more so than if he _had_ been beautiful and gifted, for then
he would not have been exclusively dependant on her love and care. Is
it not right there should be a source in the desert as well as in the
valley? Blessed is the illusion the mother’s heart lends to her eyes!
yet alas! for the “_Cagot_,” the earth brings forth healing herbs in
vain, the Church withholds her rites in vain. Their degradation, their

I regret the not having oftener noted down the hopes and agitations

apology for that fitful and impatient inequality of manner, which has
arisen from the strain of feeling which each hour has brought with
it--the pain arising from the ineffectual struggle to obtain the credit
for good intentions, and the just appreciation of my motives.

I begin to find every effort vain; and after years of anxious labour
and personal sacrifice, I have only reaped one certain harvest--the

  Dear Sir,

Last week I received yours of the 31st and Mrs. Shipley’s of the 8th
of October, by which I am happy to find you have at last effected your
exchange, and that you have the additional satisfaction to receive it
at the hands of your affectionate wife. My best wishes and compliments
attend Mrs. Shipley. Assure her from me I shall always preserve her
letter as a proof of her real affection for her husband and children.
I hope and believe the time will come when I shall have the power
to exert my friendship in your behalf; and be persuaded, that this
instance of Mrs. Shipley’s fortitude and exertions for her family will
ever find in me the warmest friend. I shall be happy to hear from you
of those events which may both tend to the honour of our country and
the advantage of you and your family. Adieu, my dear friend: God bless
you and yours again and again, and ever believe me, my good Sir,

  Yours sincerely,

  WILLIAM.

[Sidenote: Joan of Arc.]

It is not possible to reflect on the fate of this hapless Visionary
without the deepest interest: whether she be considered as really
believing herself as _Heaven-sent_, or as a young and uneducated
enthusiast, quitting her humble path in life, and by the sole aid of
her own talents obtaining the confidence of the greatest heroes of the
day. If policy rendered her a necessary victim to its purposes, it must
be lamented that such was the case.

Her statue in the market place at _Rouen_, is the first object to which
the Cicerone of that town conducts the curious traveller; but I would
recommend my countrymen to avoid this spot: as an _Englishwoman_ I felt
uncomfortable, when I turned from the meek placid features shaded by
the plumes of the warrior’s casque. The comments of my Norman guide
were needless, and in reply to his invectives against “les Anglais,” I
could only sigh, “’Tis true, ’tis pity--pity ’tis ’tis true.”

“Jeanne d’Arc, known by the designation of the ‘Maid of Orleans,’ was
born at the village of Domremi sur Meuse, and was a servant at an inn:
being endowed with bodily strength, and a hardihood of character beyond
her sex, she introduced herself to the brave _Dunois_, as the chosen
champion of France, and distinguished herself in the cause of Charles
VII. She was taken prisoner at _Compiegn_ in 1430, and conducted to
_Rouen_, where, being condemned as a sorceress by the Ecclesiastical
Power, to which she was given up by the English chiefs, she was burnt
alive in the public market place. In speaking of this unfortunate
Amazon, _Malherbe_ aptly observes that, having lived like _Alcides_, it
was just she should die as he died.

    L’ennemi tous droits violant,
    Belle Amazone, en vous brûlant
    Témoigna son âme perfide;
    Mais le destin n’eut point de tort;
    Celle qui vivoit comme _Alcide_,
    Devoit mourir comme il est mort.

[Sidenote: The awakened Idolater.]

Until I sought and found the living God, I was an Idolater. I asked
the carved wood to lengthen my days, and the sapless image to give me
health. I fashioned a statue of molten silver, and bowed down before
the works of my hands. I adored the brute nourished by my care, and
demanded protection from the herbs planted by my labour. But when I
reflected that all things perished, I asked how I could be indebted for
life to that which could not ensure life to itself? The glorious sun
then appeared to me deserving of worship, until my mind enquired by
whom that sun was made.

I examined the texture of a flower, and called it admirable: I watched
the motions of an insect, and beheld its organs perfect: I strove to
build a nest, but the sparrow was the better workman. I saw the cranes
fly against the wind, and the fishes against the stream, and I asked,
who had taught them thus to protect their feathers and their scales.
I marked the birds of passage, and said to the new-fledged swallow
prepared for flight, Why thus leave thy home for distant and unknown
regions? Wilt thou find good and congenial air whither thou goest? Who
instructs thee when to depart? Who will guide thy course through the
trackless firmament? and how wilt thou know the season to return? I
saw the woodpecker turn her eggs, that they might equally receive the
vital warmth; and the partridge trail her wing before the ensnarer, to
beguile his footsteps from her young. I observed that the wild beasts
slept while man was abroad, and that they sought their prey while man
slept. How equally, said I, are the waters balanced, and how great the
influence of the stars! The movements of the planets, the changes of
the moon, the repelling and attracting qualities of the sun, all--all
alike marvellous and sublime. Whom do these things obey? what hand doth
direct the great machinery of the universe? and for whom were all these
goodly wonders created? I then looked upon myself: I examined my limbs,
my powers, my senses. There is a Providence! I cried, and the idols
of wood dropped from my hand. There is but one God! I exclaimed, the
Almighty, Creator of all things in heaven and on earth, Source of all
good and harmony; and henceforth, Him only will I worship!

Authorised by the doctrines of the age, by his consequent education,
and by the natural gravity and elevation of his own mind to ascend the
throne as the anointed of his Creator, it was the doom of Charles I.
to witness the divine authority of his crown trampled upon, the might
of his magnificent hierarchy overwhelmed, the civil institutions of
his realm swept away, all that he deemed sacred profaned, all that he
revered denied, all that he considered established subverted, and in
their stead new doctrines and new practices introduced, much of which
was monstrous, and all extraordinary. In this unparalleled state of
affairs, instead of disappearing from the stage like an insignificant
actor overwhelmed by the unexpected importance of his part, we find
on the contrary the English monarch the most energetic and the most
interesting personage during the long, the fearful, and the dubious
struggle. When the struggle was over, the king came forward, and closed
his career by a most miserable death--dying with the same decision
with which he had lived; and while he was covered with execration and
obloquy as the _tyrant_, by one party, who feared that if he were not a
tyrant, they might perhaps be considered traitors, he was hailed by the
greater portion of the nation with tears and prayers as the martyr.

_The Petition of a Monkey under Sentence of Exile._

    The humble petition of sorrowful Peter!
    With submission set forth, and runs thus in metre.
    I think if I’m rightly informed of the crime
    For which I am banish’d, it stands thus in rhyme;
    For tearing of books, for mischief and stealing,
    And tricks of all kinds, from the ground to the ceiling.
    All culprits are punished, if Lord Coke says true,
    Not for love of revenge, but for harm that they do;
    On this common maxim my pleadings I found,
    And th’ affair of the book must soon fall to the ground.
    There was never a book, I’ll be bound to engage,
    Above all, in our day, but might well spare a page,
    And mankind, as well as e’en authors, might look
    With smiles on a monkey devouring a book.
    ’Tis as well for a volume, I’ll hazard an oath,
    To be chew’d by a monkey, as by critic or moth:
    And then, as to reading, all wits have confest it,
    You never can profit, unless you digest it;
    And monkeys and men, from the north to the south,
    Can only digest what they put in their mouth.
    Much more might be said, if I chose to enlarge,
    But I’d rather proceed to the rest of my charge.
    To accuse me of mischief, and tax me with stealing,
    Is really a want of all sense and all feeling,
    Since Nature, who ripens the figs and the grapes,
    Is no nearer kindred to man than to apes;
    And the fair teeming Earth, our bountiful mother,
    Loves Peter as dearly as Adam his brother.
    ’Tis because you are strongest, you seize upon all,
    And the weakest, we know, must be forc’d to the wall.
    Equipt as I am, in my shabby old gray,
    I cannot quite hazard what other folks may;
    But could I, yet I speak with respect and submission,
    By some lucky hit get an Ensign’s commission--
    I see you all laugh, but titter away,
    I’m not the _first_ monkey, I’ll venture to say.
    ’Tis no such hard matter to play well at cards,
    And I think I should soon be the _ton_ in the Guards.
    As to height, I confess with regret I’m not tall,
    But Lord A--c--m and I might parade in the Mall.
    And a bag from Miss Brace,[3] with a good handsome wig,
    Might, I think, pretty soon put on foot an intrigue.
    What might not be done with my air, and my shape,
    At a Court where ’tis the fashion to look like an ape?
    What duels! what battles! what murders! what slaughters!
    What tears would be shed both by mothers and daughters!
    What groups in the anguish of cutting a horn,
    Would wish in despair I had never been born!
    Yet faith, to my sorrow I fear I should see
    Ten thousand much more like to monkeys than me,
    And mad for some fair one might steal forth to meet her,
    And find her eloping with some other Peter.
    Yet spite of these rubs, I should have the renown,
    To be one of the finest young fellows in town.
    Then since exile’s my fate, I implore with a tear,
    To be shipped off for England, for that is my sphere.
    If to this my petition, you start no objection,
    My cousin, Tom Erskine, has pledged his protection,
    I suppose, like the Scots--on account of connection!

It was the commandment of the Eternal God himself, delivered amid the

Man may persecute, sickness may change, grief may depress, poverty may
chill, or grief may blacken the heart of the parent, but the bonds of
the child are never loosened.

The affection of a child for a parent, in its strongest degree does not
amount to a hundredth part of that which a parent feels for a child;
and it is not until the child becomes a parent, that he is aware of
this. If the voice of infancy should ever call you “Mother,” you will
then know (but never till then) how hard, how impossible it is to dry
up the fountain of a parent’s love, or teach the trunk to shake off and
cast from it the blossoms which thence derive their being.

    Doubts and fears from my bosom were driven;

How often does the eye rest unconsciously upon mute inanimate objects,

I was remarking one evening to a friend of my mother’s, the extreme
magnificence in the style of the still beautiful though faded furniture
of the apartments she occupied in Paris, and in which, at that moment,
a large and gay party were assembled. “True,” replied he, “and I have
seen these rooms in all their splendour, whilst their lovely, though
frail mistress, dispensed her fascinating smiles upon an admiring
circle. This house was fitted up by the celebrated St. Amaranthe,
whose fate offers one of the most striking instances of revolutionary
despotism.

“It is well known that even the stern heart of the tyrant Robespierre
had felt her power, but this was no security against his atrocious
cruelty. He was one of thirteen guests assembled on the preceding night
in the _Rue de Gramont_, where he had partaken of the hospitality of
the beauteous hostess. The next morning, whilst employed in the duties
of his toilette, his Secretary observed to him that he had drunk
too freely the night before. ‘What leads you to think so?’ inquired
Robespierre, ‘Your unguarded conversation, Citizen, which I do not
think passed unobserved, either by St. Amaranthe or her guests.’ ‘It
matters not,’ said the tyrant with apparent indifference, ‘they will do
me no harm,’ writing at the same moment a note which he dispatched by a
servant, and then with the utmost composure continued to shave himself.

“That note conveyed his orders for the arrest of St. Amaranthe and the
eleven individuals who had supped with her, one of whom was her son, a
boy of thirteen; and on the following day, the only two of the party of
fourteen who were not led to the guillotine were _Robespierre_ and _his
Secretary_.

“St. Amaranthe dressed herself with peculiar care for her execution,
and a person who by chance saw her pass in the fatal cart which
conducted her to death, described to me the beauty and elegance of the
figure, around which the most tastefully arranged draperies of _yellow_
crape floated on the air.”

    So justly famous for its choir,
    Each Sunday, when the organ’s sound
    Did from the sacred walls rebound,
    A gentleman, some say of note,
    Joined with the choristers his throat
    To praise the Lord, or show his skill,
    I know not; be it as it will,
    With open mouth and lifted eye
    He made the solemn cadence die;
    And when they raised the sacred song,
    His voice was heard above the throng.
    The cause of all this strange emotion,

    Observed that near a woman sat,
    Adown whose ancient wrinkled face
    The trickling tears did run apace;
    With kerchief clean she wiped her eyes,
    And stifled, as they rose, her sighs.
    The songster harbour’d not a doubt
    How this emotion came about:
    He knew his voice had pleas’d each ear,
    But ne’er before had drawn a tear;
    He knew he oft had charm’d the young,
    And joy’d that age now felt his tongue.
    The service o’er, the crowd retires,

    To know from Goody what soft part

    Goody, a word--I won’t detain you,

    The time when first began my woe,
    I had an ass in my possession,
    For selling brooms is my profession;
    He bore my besoms, drew my cart,
    And was the darling of my heart:
    Each night, I turn’d him to the wood
    To browse the bushes for his food.
    One night, when all was calm and still,
    Some wicked foxes from the hill,
    Attack’d the honest, harmless beast,
    And of his carcass made a feast.
    Excuse me, Sir, if when I hear
    Your worship’s voice, I shed a tear:
    When it so loud and shrill does rise,
    I think I hear poor Cuddy’s cries:
    So like his braying is your shake,
    My very heart is like to break!

                   MORAL.

At the interview between Henry VIII. and Francis I. which took place
at Guisnes, Henry and his English cavaliers wore on their crests the
Hawthorn, a cherished though humble badge, from the circumstance of
Henry VII. having placed on his head, in Bosworth Field, the crown of
England, which had been discovered in a hawthorn bush. It was on this
occasion, that when Henry was about to read the articles of the treaty
the monarchs had met to execute, that instead of designating himself
King of _France_, he stopped abruptly after “I Henry, King of England,”
and exclaimed, “No, not the King of France: I should be an impostor if
I claimed that title, for the King of France is here!”

[Sidenote: Anecdote of Torregiano.]

Torregiano, a native of Florence, who came to Seville in 1520, was
employed by the Duke of Arcos in making an exact copy of a statue
in clay, which had been executed by himself, and which was greatly
valued by all connoisseurs. When it was finished, the Duke paid him in
maravedes, and the quantity was so great that two men were required to
carry it to his lodging.

The artist rejoiced in this liberal payment, as he supposed it, but on
opening the bags and ascertaining that they contained copper, and not
silver, and that the value was trifling, he became furious, ran to the
palace of the Duke, and before his face, broke the statue in pieces.
The figure being an image of our Saviour, he was accused of heresy,
and consigned to the Inquisition, and that tribunal sentenced him to
a severe castigation, which the indignant artist escaped by starving
himself to death in prison, previous to the time appointed for the
execution of his sentence.

Bruce, like many other heroes, was an observer of omens, and a singular
instance is recorded by tradition.--After he had been four times
defeated in his attempts to recover and secure the crown of Scotland,
he was on the point of abandoning all future opposition to what
appeared to be his fate, and to go to the Holy Land. It chanced that
his eyes, as he was thus pondering, were attracted by the exertions
of a _spider_, which, in order to fix his web, endeavoured to swing
himself from one beam to another above his head. Involuntarily he
became interested in the pertinacity with which the insect renewed its
exertions after failing six times; and it occurred to him, that he
would decide his own course according to the success or failure of that
of the spider. At the _seventh_ effort the insect gained its object,
and Bruce, in like manner, persevered and carried his own.

Hence, it has been held unlucky and ungrateful, for any one of the name
of Bruce to kill a spider!

Dissipation of mind, and a length of time, are the remedies to which
the greatest part of mankind trust in their afflictions; but the first
of these works a temporary, the second a slow effect, and both are
unworthy of a wise man. Are we to fly from ourselves that we may fly
from our misfortunes, and fondly imagine that the disease is cured
because we find means to get some few minutes from pain? Or shall we
expect from Time, the physician of brutes, a lingering and uncertain
deliverance? Shall we wait to be happy, till we can forget we are
miserable? and owe to the weakness of our faculties a tranquillity
which ought to be the effect of our strength? Far otherwise, let us
set all our past and present afflictions at once before our eyes; let
us resolve to overcome them, instead of flying from them, or wearing
out the sense of them by a long and ignominious patience; instead of
palliating remedies, let us use the incision knife and the caustic;
search the wound to the bottom, and work an immediate and radical cure.

love, nature, honouring the most sacred of her feelings, forbids a

the loss which bids that tear to flow can never be replaced by human

Frederick the Great, on the death of one of his chaplains, being
desirous of replacing him by a man of talent, took the following mode
of ascertaining the qualifications of the candidate for the nomination.
He told the applicant that he would himself furnish him with a text the
following Sunday, from which he was to preach extempore. The clergyman
accepted the offer. The whim of such a probationary sermon was spread
abroad widely, and at an early hour the Royal chapel was crowded to
excess. The King arrived at the close of the prayers, and, on the
clergyman’s ascending the pulpit, one of His Majesty’s Aides-de-Camp
presented him with a sealed letter. The preacher opened it, and found
nothing but a blank paper, yet in so critical a moment he did not
lose his presence of mind. “My brethren,” said he, turning the paper
on both sides, “here is nothing, and there is nothing; out of nothing
God created all things.” And he proceeded to deliver a most admirable
discourse on the wonders of the creation.

A susceptibility to delicate attentions, a fine sense of the nameless
and exquisite tenderness of manner and thought, constitute in the minds
of its possessors the deepest under current of life: the felt and
treasured, but unseen and inexpressible richness of affection. It is
rarely found in the characters of men, but it outweighs, when it is,
all grosser qualities. There are many who waste and lose affections
by careless and, often, unconscious neglect. It is not a plant to grow
untended; the breath of indifference, or rude touch, may destroy for
ever its delicate texture. There is a daily attention to the slight
courtesies of life, which can alone preserve the first freshness of
passion. The easy surprises of pleasure, earnest cheerfulness of
assent to slight wishes, the habitual respect to opinions, the polite
abstinence from personal topics in the company of others, unwavering
attention to his and her comfort, both abroad and at home, and above
all, the careful preservation of those proprieties of conversation and
manner which are sacred when before the world, are some of the secrets
of that rare happiness which age and habit alike fail to impair or

[Sidenote: Whitehall.]

The old Palace of Whitehall occupied a considerable space along the
banks of the Thames, contiguous to where Westminster Bridge now stands;
commencing at the present Privy Gardens, and ending near Scotland
Yard. It extended also from the River to St. James’s Park, along the
boundary of which, including the Cockpit and Spring Gardens, many of
its buildings were situated. Hubert de Burgh, Justiciary of England
in the reign of Henry III. who was its first owner, left it in 1242
to the Monastery of Black Friars, Holborn, who selling it to Walter
Gray, Archbishop of York, it subsequently became the property of
succeeding prelates, and was the York House more than once mentioned by
Shakespeare. Henry VIII. taking a fancy to it, Wolsey, as Archbishop
of York, found it prudent to dispose of the Palace to that arbitrary
monarch, from whose time it became the residence of the sovereigns of
England till 1695, when it was consumed by fire; and Queen Anne in
consequence removed to St. James’s. Henry VIII. threw a gallery across
the street to the new Park of St. James’s, which was formed about the
same time from the grounds of a dissolved monastery of this name, and
erected on that side of the way a Cockpit, a Tennis Court, &c. Many
of Cromwell’s letters about this time are dated from the Cockpit,
whilst his subsequent ones are usually dated Whitehall. The Banqueting
House, now commonly called Whitehall, which was built by James I. in
the room of an old building devoted by Elizabeth to a similar purpose,
alone escaped the fire; and still remains a monument of the purer
taste introduced by Inigo Jones. It was the only part of the intended
new structure built by him. The roof was painted by Rubens, 1629, who
received from Charles I. three thousand pounds and knighthood for his
labour.

the _morality of instinct_, the _sacrament of nature and duty_; or
rather miscalled a _duty_, for it flows from the heart without effort,
and is its delight, its indulgence, its enjoyment. It is guided, not
by the slow dictates of reason; it awaits not encouragement from
reflection or from thought; it asks no aid of memory; it is not innate,
but active consciousness of having been the object of a thousand tender
solicitudes, a thousand waking watchful cares, of meek anxiety and
patient sacrifices, unremarked and unrequited by the object. It is a
gratitude founded upon a conviction of obligations, not remembered
because conferred before the tender reason could acknowledge, or
the infant memory record them: a gratitude and affection which no
circumstances should subdue, and which few can strengthen. A gratitude
in which even injury from the object, though it may blunt regret,
should never breed resentment--an affection, which can be increased
only by the decay of those to whom we owe it; and which is then most
fervent when the tremulous voice of age, resistless in its feebleness,
inquires for the natural protection of its cold decline.”

who when they were dragging Jesus out of the door of the Judgment Hall,
struck him on the back, saying, “Go faster, Jesus, go faster--why dost
thou linger?” upon which Jesus looked upon him with a frown, and said,
“I am indeed going, but thou shalt tarry till I come.” Soon after he
was converted, and took the name of Joseph. He lives for ever, but
at the end of every _hundred_ years falls into a fit or trance, from
which, when he recovers, he returns to the same age as he was when our
Saviour suffered, being then about thirty years. He always preserves

the Caryans. Upon the capture of the city, the males were put to the

order to perpetuate the ignominy of this people, introduced statues of
their women instead of columns in the porticos of their buildings; the
ornaments and drapery were faithfully copied from the attire of the
women, the mode of which they were never permitted to change.

that this right of the Red-man was founded in nature, that this tenure
was the free gift of Heaven, which no king, no pope, no man had a
right to question, or any equitable pretence to destroy; and therefore
his principles required him to commence with justice to the natural
occupant of the soil. With the founder of Pensylvania, the measures he
adopted, and his demeanour towards the aborigines were wise, and so
happy that it became a maxim among them “never to lift the tomahawk
against the race of William Penn.” The country of William Penn was
called “the Poor Man’s Paradise;” poverty was unknown in all its
borders.

With reference to the name given to the colony, it is stated by Penn
on the 5th Jan. 1681: “This day, after many waitings, watchings,
solicitings, and disputes in Counsel, my country was confirmed to me
under the Great Seal of England, with large powers and privileges, by
the name of Pensylvania, a name the king would give it in honour of
my father. I chose _New Wales_, being a hilly country; and when the
Secretary, being a Welshman, refused to call it New Wales, I proposed
Sylvania, and they added _Penn_ to it, though I much opposed it, and
went to the king to have it struck out. He said it was past, and would
take it upon him. I feared it should look like a vanity in me, and not
as a respect of the king to my father, as it really was.”

As I have myself felt the arrows of calumny, I should be inexcusable

Remember--never to divest the person of your wife of the diversity with
which your imagination clothed it while she was your mistress, and be
sedulous yourself in the preservation of every attraction as well of
the person, as of the heart.

Recollect--that it is vacuity which requires the charm of novelty: keep
the soul replete with genuine bliss, and the desire of change will
never make head against the power of pure and mutual love. The cooling
of the heart towards the object once adored, proceeds in general from
the weakness of unoccupied hours, and the inaction of sensibility.
Kind attentions mutually kept up, will always endear even indifferent
persons to each other; and will not the very name of husband, and wife,
lead to those attentions, to those endearments? The flame of love
once raised, will burn long if fanned by both the votaries; but will
inevitably expire if left only to the care of one.

_The Baths of Schlangenbad._

Schlangenbad, a short distance from Mayence: the effect of the
Schlangenbad waters on the skin is really wonderful; it seems like
exaggeration or fancy on the part of those who have described them
already, to say that one quarter of an hour’s luxurious lying under
their clear soft surface, should be able to produce such an impression.
Yet so it is, in sober earnest. I think it was two days at least before
the effect of even one bath went off; and when, forgetting what manner
of man or woman we had become in it, we afterwards happened to pass
our hands over our foreheads, either for want of thought, or in search
of some stray thought that had made its escape, the agreeable contact
waked us suddenly to the sense of the soothing, softening influence of
the waters.

[Sidenote: Traditions.]

In the thirteenth century the two chief meals were dinner and supper,
the first at nine in the morning, the supper at five in the afternoon.
The greatest luxury and magnificence were displayed at those repasts,
and the side tables were highly ornamented, and covered with various
fermented liquors, as mead, ale, beer, and, above all, rich wines
of English growth. At the celebration in London of the marriage of
Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and Cincia, daughter of Redmond, Earl of
Provence (A. D. 1243), there were above thirty thousand dishes served
at the marriage dinner.

An unlimited hospitality reigned in the castles of great barons: their
gates were ever open to strangers of condition, as well as their
own vassals, friends, and followers. It is evident that the immense
halls to be seen in the remains of ancient structures, were built to
accommodate vast numbers of guests of all ranks; and the little window
above, opening from a recess of the state apartment, was evidently
intended in order that the guests should be seen assembling, before
the lord of the mansion and persons of dignity went down to the common
repast. In the middle of each table stood a large salt-cellar, and it
was a mark of distinction whether a person sat above or below the salt.
Particular care was taken to place the guests according to their rank.

It has been wittily said of the Sicilians, that no person could pass
for a man of gallantry who had not got a _cold_, and was sure never to
succeed with his mistress unless he made love in a _hoarse voice_. This
arose from the custom of serenading the object of preference during the
hours of the night, by the execution of vocal and instrumental music
under their balconies. The Sicilians are a nation of poets; and the
lover who cannot celebrate his mistress’s charms in verse, would be
thought unworthy of her attention.

    The heart can ne’er a transport know,
      That never felt a pain;
    That point thus settled long ago,
      The present question’s vain.

    Who’d wish to travel life’s dull round,
      Unmov’d by pain or pleasure?
    ’Tis reason’s task to set the bound,
      And keep them all in measure.

    The Stoic who with false pretence
      Each soft emotion stifles,
    Thinks want of feeling shows his sense,
      Yet frets and fumes at trifles.

    And he, who vainly boasts the heart
      Touch’d by each tale of woe,
    Forbears to act the friendly part
      That tender heart to show.

    Th’ unfeeling heart can never know,
      By cold indifference guarded,
    The joy, the transport, that will flow
      From love and truth rewarded.

    True sensibility we find
      Shares in another’s grief;
    And pity yields the generous mind
      From sympathy relief.

    The point discussed, we find this rule,
      A rule both true and sad;
    Who feels too little is--a fool;
      Who feels too much--runs mad.

_To the May Fly._

    Thou art a frail and lively thing
      Engender’d by the sun;
    A moment only on the wing,
      And thy career is done.

    Thou sportest in the evening beam
      An hour--an age to thee--
    In gaiety above the stream
      Which soon thy grave must be.

    Although thy life is like to thee,

    Far happier than thou e’er could’st be,
      If long life were thy lot?

undergone all the vicissitudes of a long and eventful life? That it has
not felt all the freshness of youth, all the vigour of maturity, all

[Sidenote: Scenes from the Life of Titian.]

Titian Vecelli was born in 1477, at the Chateau of La Pieve, on the
frontiers of Friuli, one of the seven Communes of Cador. He was by
birth a gentleman, his father was Gregorio Vecelli, and his ancestors
were traced to the twelfth century.

Here may be corrected an absurdity often committed in designating
him as “_Le_ Titien,” _that_ being his baptismal name; as well say
_the_ Raphael--or _the_ Michael Angelo. The artist may certainly be
denominated “_The Vecelli_.”

Titian was not six years of age when he first gave notice of the great
art in which he was to shine so bright a star: and even then, may be
traced his transcendent genius in the power of colouring. The infant
artist took his tints from nature. The fields, the gardens were his
palettes; it was his custom to gather flowers, from which he expressed
the juices; he required no pencil, no pen, to sketch his designs, he
had discovered the fresco; instinct perfected his work; the perfume of
the flower was unheeded by this wonderful child, but he would fall in
extacies at the whiteness of the lily, the carnation of the rose, the
purple of the iris.

Titian was united in a band of most intimate friendship with Giorgione,
who had arrived from Castel-Franco, to study under Bellini, (Titian’s
master) and who called himself simply “George.” He soon became the
friend, the brother, the model of Titian; and when, in after years,
his jealousy of Titian’s talent went to such lengths as to separate
them, the latter left Venice, not being able to endure a residence in
the same city, with Giorgione thus alienated from him, nor did he ever
return to Venice till after the death of Giorgione.

In 1514, Alphonso d’Este, the reigning Duke of Ferrara, called Titian
to his court, which at that period was considered the most brilliant
and magnificent in Italy. Poets, Painters, every artist of celebrity
was there admitted, and honoured in proportion to his talents. Titian’s
long cherished dream of ambition and well earned fame, were now about
to be realized, and his glorious talent to be estimated as it deserved.
Although poor in fortune, there was no gentleman at the court of
Alphonso who could vie with him in the good taste and elegance of his
appearance. His manners were those of a high bred man: his conversation
full of charm. The Prince soon felt the superiority of his new guest,
and treated him with peculiar courtesy.

“Signor Titian,” said Alphonso, “consider our house as your own, and
be at perfect ease and freedom: my dearest wish is to render it so
agreeable to you, as to induce you to remain with us. It shall be our
care that your residence at Ferrara may lessen your regret at quitting
your beautiful Venice! Recollect though, that here pleasure takes the
precedence of business; however, if in your leisure hours you should
take up your pencil, we know too well how to appreciate your reputation
and your talent, not to recollect at proper seasons that our court is
honoured by the presence of the first painter in Venice.”

Alphonso’s conduct towards Titian fully bore out his professions, and
his favour, by giving to the artist the full scope of his enthusiasm in
his art, left to Titian nothing to desire. His sojourn at this court
was terminated by an event which not only proves the estimation with
which the duke honoured him, but gives also some idea of the morals of
the period of which we speak.

Alphonso, thinking the favour which he had bestowed on Titian entitled
him to make the request, one day entreated the great artist would
gratify him by taking the portrait of Dona Laura Eustochio d’Este, the
reigning Duchess of Ferrara.

“Listen to me, my dear Titian,” said the prince, in a tone of cordial
intimacy, “you are not ignorant (for every thing is known at a court),
that it was the surpassing beauty of my wife which induced me to marry
her, and you will easily believe how much it will gratify me, if by
your pencil her charms are rendered immortal. I know not whether the
ducal mantle will be allowed to fall at your request, this favour it
must be your task to obtain of the Duchess, but understand me well,
great master, that my ardent desire is that by your talent I should
be possessed of the faithful copy of those transcendent charms,
which have so enslaved me; and divested of all veil or drapery, as
though reflected in a mirror, such as are seen in your delightful
paintings--so that in after times, when she is represented (such as I
knew and adored her), it may be said, ‘her beauty was perfect; he was
not to blame for marrying her!’”

“Monsignore,” replied Titian, “although the artist sees and thinks
only as of a model, in the woman who is before him, were she a queen,
yet I will confess to your Highness, that I have so seldom seen the
Duchess since I have had the honour of residing at your court, and at
such times she has appeared to look on me with so much coldness and
dignity, that even by your order, I never could venture to prescribe
what attitude and costume would be most suitable: and I really think
that this would be best intimated by your Highness.”

“Not at all, my dear Titian, you know nothing of women. It suffices
that a husband wishes one thing, for them to press another. What
objections, what remonstrances, what reproaches I should have to
endure! She would insist that I had ceased to love her, and was no
longer jealous--whilst you would only speak as the painter, and would
be listened to and believed, for when Titian had said ‘On my honour,
Madam, I can make you a Venus,’ where is the woman who could oppose
him? In short, Titian, you know my wishes, do the best you can; the
Duchess expects you;” and in fact the Prince had scarcely left the
room, when two pages announced that the Duchess of Ferrara waited for
him.

In a room richly embellished with all the luxury of art, and which
would have inspired Ariosto with the enchantment of Armida’s palace,
the Duchess reclined on cushions, which yielded to every movement, a
young page of such beauty as is described in Raphael’s angels, gently
waved a fan of peacock’s feathers, and a little Ethiopian slave knelt
at his mistress’s feet, as though placed there in order to display the
whiteness of her skin by the contrast.

Into this scene Titian followed his conductor, but was struck dumb, and
seized as if with vertigo: he thought himself transported into some
region of fancy. On a sign from their mistress a seat, the easel, the
palette, the pencils and the colours were presented to the artist, and
the attendants lowly bowing withdrew, leaving Titian and the Duchess
alone.

The beauty of Laura is historical, and it were difficult to give any
adequate description of it. When Titian had recovered sufficient
self-command to render the feelings of the man subservient to those of
the artist, he raised his eyes, and fixed them on the Duchess; it was
the first time he had ever ventured to do so, for, as he had hinted,
Laura had ever appeared desirous of avoiding him; but recollecting
that he was now in her presence by the orders of the Prince, and by
nature of his business, he continued his gaze, and met in return her
gracious smile. Strange, it even seemed to him that he had seen that
face before--long since--in a dream possibly--or when the artist’s
imagination was inspired by some ideal beauty.

Titian drew the easel towards him, and respectfully bowing, said,
“Madam, I am here by your order.”

“Am I well placed thus, Sir Artist?” she replied.

The sound of this voice thrilled every nerve. He was now certain that
it was not the first time they had met; but when, where, or in what
country he had seen this woman, he had no recollection.

The Duchess with a little of impatience repeated her question.

“Perfectly, Madam,” replied Titian, beginning at the same time to
sketch the outline of the head.

“However,” he added, somewhat hesitating, “if your Highness would show
more of the hair, I think the portrait would be improved.”

“Of course, Signor Titian, your advice is law.” And the Duchess
proceeded to unbind her veil, and remove the jewels which confined
those beautiful tresses, which like a golden shower fell on her snow
white neck and shoulders. “What magnificent hair!” exclaimed the artist
in an under tone; “yes, surely I have seen this woman before; but then
she had not the transcendent beauty she has since attained, and which
now renders her the most perfect model a painter could wish.”

Titian worked on as if inspired; and when the head and part of the
shoulders were sufficiently advanced to allow the artist to satisfy the
curiosity of the fair original, Titian permitted the Duchess to look at
the canvass. On beholding the likeness, and the beauty of the sketch,
Laura d’Este uttered a cry of surprise and admiration.

“You see, Madam, how much has been gained by yielding to my request to
remove that heavy head dress, and you will, I hope, equally comply
with my wish to see that gown taken off; attend, I beg you, Madam, to
an artist’s advice--uncover those shoulders, so perfect in shape, that
bust, so exquisitely formed, the contour of which is perfection. Surely
it was not to paint a bit of stuff, or a knot of riband that God has
endowed us with a talent of creation only secondary to his own great
power; for I too can give life to that world of beauty, and when it
shall have ceased to exist, it will survive on my canvass.”

“I no longer wonder that I was told to beware of Titian,” said the
Duchess, as she gradually obeyed the painter’s directions; “our great
Ariosto is not the only flatterer at our court.”

“If, Madam, you doubt my word, consult this mirror; its reflection is
not more true than my language.”

As by degrees the Duchess, in compliance with Titian’s wishes,
uncovered her foot, her leg, her knee--the whole of the admirable form
which had placed on her fair brow the crown of Ferrara--Titian recalled
the past; the vague ideas which had floated in his brain assumed
consistency, and a name, a date, were all left wanting to satisfy him.

And now the exquisite outline was nearly complete; one only obstacle
remained, the few folds of velvet which like a dark shade fell on the
form of snow white beauty, and prevented this master-piece of art from
shining forth in all its dazzling perfection.

“How happy was that artist,” exclaimed Titian with bitterness, “whose
chisel was suffered to sculpture the Venus of old in all the chaste
nudity of nature! He did not look on diamonds and draperies. Oh! were
the same privilege given me, this day should my pencil also produce a
Venus de Medicis!”

“Behold me, then!” exclaimed the Duchess, half laughing.

Titian, turning round, uttered a cry of amazement.

The wife of Don Alphonso of Ferrara had dropped her last veil, and
reclined on her divan precisely in the same attitude in which at this
time Titian’s Venus may still be seen with delight in the gallery at
Florence.

“Great God! I was not then mistaken,” said Titian, hurrying towards her.

“Well!”

“It is you!”

“It is me. Your model--your Laurette! Ungrateful man! you had then
forgotten me!”

“Can I believe it? the daughter of poor Guanetto?”

“Yes, she, who for a morsel of bread came to stand in your studio as
a model, at Venice, is now the Sovereign of Ferrara. But the most
surprising part of the event is, that her old lord and master persisted
in his forgetfulness, and refused to recognise the Duchess of Ferrara
till she had again descended to her humble capacity of a model.”

“I thought, indeed, those features were not unknown to me.”

“Well, this is something.--However, I forgive you. Twelve years have
elapsed, and I must be much altered.”

“And how did you attain your present position?”

“As the wife of Don Alphonso? Simply thus. He saw me, loved me, and
married me--nothing more natural.”

“Yes, he loves you, I have the proof of this.”

“He adores me. Ever since your arrival at Ferrara, he has entreated me
to give him this portrait. I avoided it as long as I could, but was
at length obliged to consent to prevent his being seriously grieved.
God knows, I dreaded the moment enough! for....” And the young woman
hesitated, and sighed.

“I understand: prudence bade you avoid me.”

“No, it was shame.”

Titian bowed down his head, and appeared buried in thought: when he had
somewhat recovered himself, and was able to speak--“Come, Madam,” he
said kindly but firmly, “replace your splendid robe, and adjust your
head-dress. This sketch is now useless, and I will complete it another
time. In my studio I have a portrait of you such as the Prince desires
to possess. But I wish also to paint you for your subjects: since fate
has placed a sovereign crown on your head, it shall not be said that I
have deprived you of it, even in a picture.”

“But what will my husband say?”

“He can but be pleased; for instead of the one portrait ordered, there
will be two--one as a Venus, the other as a Princess.”

Three days afterwards, Titian had returned to Venice....

Titian at this period was about thirty-seven years of age. He was tall
and dignified, his forehead high, his eyes large and full of expression
and feeling, his profile was correctly Grecian, his long beard curled
naturally, he was framed to inspire respect and love. His manners were
all grace, his smile enchanting.

After his return to Venice, he lived in princely style, so as to vie
even with the splendour of the palace of the Doge. Affable, cheerful,
generous, he was beloved even by his rivals. No artist ever acquired
such wealth, or lavished it more generously and willingly.

[Sidenote: Pacheco. Granella.]

Two Cardinals one day called unexpectedly at his _Atelier_, and told
him they came to dine with him. Titian detained them a short time under
pretence of retouching their portraits, and when unobserved, threw
his purse out of the window, saying to a servant, “I have some one to
dinner.” In an hour after, their Eminences sat down to a repast served
with regal splendour.

Titian’s studio was the resort and rendezvous of every remarkable
personage in Europe: from every quarter of the world people hurried
to behold the venerable old man, who approached his hundredth year.
Henry III. King of France and Poland, attended by the Dukes of Ferrara,
Mantua, and Albano, paid a visit of ceremony to the distinguished
artist, and conversed at length with him on the subject of his
honourable reception at the several courts of Charles V. and of
Ferdinand and Philip. He admired all his collection of pictures, and
having selected those he was desirous of purchasing, he begged that
Titian would himself name the sum he should pay for them, and which
should be immediately laid down. The old man smiled, and rising with

Titian was unequalled in his talent for giving _life_ to his portraits.
It is an undoubted fact that having placed the portrait of Paul III. on
his terrace, to dry the varnish, the people who passed by, supposing
it to be really the Pope taking the air on the balcony, stopped to bow
with reverence to his Holiness.

Titian died of the plague raging in Venice, in 1576. Regrets and tears
followed the splendid artist to the tomb, in the church of St. Luc,
where he was interred with the highest honours.

_Diospyrus Lotus_ is a handsome tree for a shrubbery. It grows very
gracefully, spreading out its branches, and its leaves are tinged
underneath with a beautiful pink, and covered with a long, soft,
pinkish down. It is quite hardy.

Also the Locust tree of the Americans, _Robina pseudacacia_; it
receives its name from Jean Robins, the Herbalist of Henry IV. and is
very hardy. The flowers, which are very sweet, resemble a bunch of
white laburnum.

_The Hand of Heaven._

    Despair, and suffering, and sorrow,
      Had poured their bitterness on me;
    Hope had no ray to gild the morrow,
      And life was only misery.

    Each coming day shed deeper sadness,
      And health along with hope had fled;
    Religion only saved from madness
      This aching agonized head.

    At length, when nature’s pulse was dying,
      That Power, which brought religious balm
    Gave back the life that seem’d fast flying,
      With health, and hope, and peaceful calm.

    Cease then, woe’s child, thy deep despairing;
      Remember, Heaven’s hand can save,
    Though every sorrow thou art sharing,
      Though life seems hov’ring o’er the grave.

Surely the presence of sublimity and beauty must render the temperament
of those who dwell in such solitudes poetical; and yet the mountain
shepherd is only weather wise. Always simple, often stupid, he is
scarcely superior in intelligence to his watch dogs, which are at the
same time his coadjutors, his playfellows, and his protectors.

It is strange, if--living here alone amid the snows, removed from the
contagious vices of mankind, from the coarse sensuality, the brutality,
the debasement too often found in the world, from the temptations,
the struggles, the strife produced by want, envy, ambition, the love
of gain; constantly familiar with the ever varying face of primitive
nature, with her grandest and loveliest aspects--the mind be not
elevated, and the soul pure. Hourly are sights beheld, seen only in
these regions. The glaciers reflecting tints of every hue, gilded with
sunshine, or glowing with rose light. The stars, no longer brilliant
specks, but appearing as they are, globes of intense fire. The moon,
seeming to shed with her white beams the coldness of the icy skies. The
whistling, the howling of the blast, its subterranean muttering, the
roar of the thunder, all prolonged by a hundred echoes. The lightning
flashing upon a numerous crystal-like pinnacle, the shivered pines,
the rent rocks, the sublimity of the tempest! Then the dread silence
which succeeds. The fleecy snow no longer falls; all is entranced by
the mighty spell of frost; all mute, all motionless. Spring returns;
the sun regains his power; light fleecy clouds float in the heavens;
soft, balmy rains descend: below, verdure, foliage, and flowers burst
forth with almost the first gleam of sunshine: but ah! the torrents are
unbound, the masses of snow tremble, they are loosened, they fall: the
avalanche overwhelms the valley with destruction and desolation.

The Rainbow Coffee-house, near Temple Bar, one of the oldest taverns
in the metropolis, was kept by James Fan, a barber, soon after the
introduction of coffee into England. Three years previous to the
Restoration, anno 1657, he was presented by the Inquest of St.
Dunstan’s in the West, “For making and selling a sort of liquor called
‘Coffee,’ as a great nuisance and prejudice of the neighbourhood,” &c.
Strange as it may appear, within half a century of this period, namely
in 1708, there were upwards of three thousand Coffee-houses in London
alone. An old author says, Who would have thought, after the prejudice
against coffee, which was considered pernicious and a public nuisance,
it would have been, as now, so much drunk “by the _best of quality_,
and by _physicians_?”

[Sidenote: Duchesse d’Abrantes.]

Her writings are not better known to the world, than her kind and
generous mind were to those who had remained faithful during her many
and great reverses of fortune. In the zenith of power, when her smile
or frown could give value or discredit to those who surrounded her,
she was a friend of the needy, a protectress of the weak. Her position
often created envy, but her winning manner, her graceful accueil
converted many an envious discontented spirit into an admiring friend.
In her trials and reverses she was made to feel how few are the friends
and followers of prosperity whose feelings do not become chilled by the
sight of adversity.

The same kind and conciliatory manner, the same noble enthusiasm, the
same powers of conversation, refined and heightened by the literary
career she had adopted to ward off the actual and pressing gripe of
poverty, were still hers; but their value was differently estimated.
The small and modest apartment could boast of but few of the _habitués_
who had formerly swelled to suffocation the crowd that formerly
frequented her gilded _salons_. Some few were to be found, however,
surrounding her couch of pain, and never had she taken so much trouble
to court and conciliate the richest nobles, the reigning princes of
her own and other lands, as she now did to show her cordial welcome,
and the heartfelt pleasure she felt in beholding the faithful few,
who dreamed not while listening to her brilliant wit, her sparkling
reminiscences of bright fêtes in which she had been a principal
actress, that the finger of death was already on her, that her moments
of life and vivacity freely given for their amusement, were stimulated
by the excessive use of opium, while her hours of racking pain and
mental anguish were confined to her own bosom.

She died in poverty; she who had given away in charity a hundred times
more than would have made her last days comparatively affluent and
easy--died in want. Her last days, nay hours, disturbed by pressing,
though trifling demands. She died in an _Hospital_ for the destitute.

I am proud to remember that she honoured me with her esteem and
friendship.

The following are the words to which the Jacobites sing the air of “God

Gourie, Perthshire.

    God save the King, I pray,
    God bless the King, I pray,
      God save the King;
    Send him victorious,
    Happy, and glorious,
    Soon to reign over us,
      God save the King!

    God bless the Prince of Wales,
    The true born Prince of Wales[5]
      Sent us by Thee;
    Grant us one favour more,
    The King for to restore,
    As thou hast done before,
      The familie!

This tradition may remind the reader of the answer of the Jacobite
Countess, to the reproach of “not praying for the King.”--“For the
King, I do pray; but I do not think it necessary to tell God _who is
the King_.”

about the time of the rebellion, 1715, or before it.

experiment before the Emperor Charles V. with it, when they descended
with a lighted candle to a considerable depth. In 1683, William Phipps,
the son of a blacksmith, formed a project for unloading a rich Spanish
ship, sunk at Hispaniola; Charles II. gave him a ship, with every
necessary for the undertaking, but being unsuccessful, Phipps returned
in great poverty. He then endeavoured to procure another vessel,
but failing, he got a subscription, to which the Duke of Albemarle
contributed. In 1687, Phipps set sail in a ship of 200 tons, having
previously engaged to divide the profits according to the twenty
shares of which the subscription consisted. At first all his labours
proved fruitless, but at length, when he seemed almost to despair, he
was fortunate enough to bring up so much treasure that he returned to
England with £200,000 sterling. Of this sum he got about £20,000, and
the Duke of Albemarle £90,000. Phipps was knighted by the King, and
laid the foundation of the present house of Mulgrave.

with some sort of fortitude, that hideous chasm that lies between us
and that state, death. View those miseries, then, as the special acts
of mercy and commiseration of a beneficent Creator, who with every
calamity, melts away a link of that earthly chain that fetters our

_Letter of Marian Delorme to M. de Cinq. Mars._

  Paris, Feb. 1641.
  My dear Effiat,

While you are forgetting me at Narbonne, and giving yourself up to the
pleasures of the court and the delight of thwarting M. le Cardinal de
Richelieu, I, according to your express desire, am doing the honours of
Paris to your English lord, the Marquis of Worcester; and I carry him
about, or rather he carries me, from curiosity to curiosity, choosing
always the most grave and serious, speaking very little, listening with
extreme attention, and fixing on those whom he interrogates two large
blue eyes, which seem to pierce to the very centre of their thoughts.
He is remarkable for never being satisfied with any explanations which
are given him; and he never sees things in the light in which they
are shown him: you may judge of this by a visit we made together to
Bicêtre, where he imagined he had discovered a genius in a madman. If
this madman had not been actually raving, I verily believe your Marquis
would have entreated his liberty, and have carried him off to London,
in order to hear his extravagancies, from morning till night, at his
ease. We were crossing the court of the madhouse, and I, more dead than
alive with fright, kept close to my companion’s side, when a frightful
face appeared behind some immense bars, and a hoarse voice exclaimed,
“I am not mad! I am not mad! I have made a discovery which would
enrich the country that adopted it.” “What has he discovered?” I asked
of our guide. “Oh!” he answered, shrugging his shoulders, “something
trifling enough; you would never guess it: it is the use of the steam
of boiling water.” I began to laugh. “This man,” continued the keeper,
“is named Solomon de Caus: he came from Normandy four years ago, to
present to the king a statement of the wonderful effects that might be
produced from his invention. To listen to him, you would imagine that
with steam you could navigate ships, move carriages, in fact, there is
no end to the miracles which, he insists upon it, could be performed.
The Cardinal sent the madman away without listening to him. Solomon de
Caus, far from being discouraged, followed the Cardinal wherever he
went, with the most determined perseverance, who, tired of finding him
for ever in his path, and annoyed to death with his folly, ordered him
to be shut up in Bicêtre, where he has now been for three years and a
half, and where, as you hear, he calls out to every visitor that he is
not mad, but that he has made a valuable discovery. He has even written
a book on the subject, which I have here.”[6] Lord Worcester, who had
listened to this account with much interest, after reflecting a time,

“This man is not mad. In my country, instead of shutting him up, he
would have been rewarded. Take me to him, for I should like to ask him
some questions.”

He was, accordingly, conducted to his cell, but after a short time,
he came back sad and thoughtful--“He is, indeed, mad now,” said he,
“misfortune and captivity have alienated his reason, but it is you who
have to answer for his madness: when you cast him into that cell, you
confined the greatest genius of the age.”

After this, we went away, and since that time he has done nothing but
talk of Solomon de Caus.

Adieu, my dear friend and faithful Henry. Make haste and come back, and
pray do not be so happy where you are, as not to keep a little love for
me.

Was there ever seen a smile on the lip, with which the upper part of
the face agrees not in expression, that was not evidently feigned and
forced,[7] to be the disguise of a mind ill at ease, and of a sick
spirit? The mind looks through the eyes, and the brow should smile in
unison with the lip, to show the joy sincere.

    How solemn is the sick man’s room,
      To friends or kindred lingering near;
    Poring on that uncertain gloom
      In silent heaviness and fear!

    How sad, his feeble hand in thine,
      The start of every pulse to share;
    With painful haste each wish divine,
      Yet feel the hopelessness of care.

    To turn aside the full fraught eye,
      Lest those faint orbs perceive the tear;
    To bear the weight of every sigh,
      Lest it should reach that wakeful ear.

    In the dead stillness of the night,
      To lose the faint, faint sound of breath;
    To listen in restrain’d affright,
      To deprecate each thought of death.

    And when a movement chased that fear,
      And gave thy heart-blood leave to flow,
    In thrilling awe the prayer to hear,
      Through the clos’d curtain murmur’d low.

    The prayer of him whose holy tongue
      Had never yet exceeded truth;
    Upon whose guardian care had hung
      The whole dependance of thy youth.

    Who noble, dauntless, frank, and mild,
      Was for his very goodness fear’d;
    Beloved with fondness like a child,
      And like a blessed saint rever’d.

    I have known friends--but who can feel
      The kindness such a father knew?
    I serv’d him still with tender zeal,
      But knew not then how much was due.

    And did not Providence ordain
      That we should soon be laid as low,
    No heart could such a stroke sustain,
      No reason would survive the blow.

[Sidenote: The Plague.]

The fearful progress and effects of the dreadful pestilence which
visited England during the reign of Edward III. are traced by a
masterly hand in the work from which this extract is made.

“In the malignancy of this extraordinary disease, it engrossed the ill
of all other maladies, and made doctors despicable. Of a potency equal
to death, it possessed itself of all its armouries, and was itself the
death of every other mortal distemper. The touch, yea, the very sight
of the infected was deadly; and its signs were so sudden, that families
seated in happiness at their meals, have seen the _plague-spot_ begin
to redden, and have wildly scattered themselves for ever. The cement
of society was dissolved by it. Mothers, when they saw the sign of
the infection on the babes at their bosom cast them from them with
abhorrence. Wild places were sought for shelter: some went into ships,
and anchored themselves afar off on the waters. But the angel that was
pouring the vial had a foot on the sea as well as on the dry land. No
place was so wild that the plague did not visit,--none so secret that
the quick-sighted pestilence did not discover--none could fly that it
did not overtake.

“It was as if Heaven had repented the making of mankind, and was
shovelling them all into the sepulchre. Justice was forgotten, and her
courts deserted. The terrified jailors fled from the felons that were
in fetters; the innocent and the guilty leagued themselves together,
and kept within their prisons for safety; the grass grew in the market
places; the cattle went moaning up and down the fields, wondering
what had become of their keepers: the rooks and the ravens came into
the towns, and built their nests in the mute belfries; silence was
universal, save when some infected wretch was seen clamouring at a
window.

“For a time all commerce was in coffins and shrouds; but even that
ended. Shrift there was none; churches and chapels were open, but
neither priests nor penitent entered; all went to the charnel-house.
The sexton and the physician were cast into the same deep and wide
grave; the testator and his heirs and executors were hurled from the
same cart into the same hole together. Fire became extinguished, as if
its element too had expired; the seams of the sailorless ships yawned
to the sun. Though doors were open, and coffers unwatched, there was
no theft; all offences ceased, and no cry but the universal woe of
the pestilence was heard of among men. The wells overflowed, and the
conduits ran to waste; the dogs banded themselves together, having
lost their masters and ran howling over all the land; horses perished
of famine in their stalls; old friends but looked at one another when
they met, keeping themselves far aloof; creditors claimed no debts, and
courtiers performed their promises; little children went wandering up
and down, and numbers were seen dead in all corners. Nor was it only in
England that the plague raged; it travelled over a third part of the
whole earth, like the shadow of an eclipse, as if some dreadful thing
had been interposed between the world and the sun-source of life.”

[Sidenote: Trifles.]

    Since trifles make the sum of human things,
    And half our misery from trifles springs,
    Since life’s best joys consist in peace and ease,
    And few can serve, or save, but all may please,
    Oh! let the ungentle spirit learn from hence,
    A small unkindness is a great offence!
    Large bounties to bestow, we wish in vain,
    But all may shun the guilt of giving pain.
    To bless mankind with tides of flowing wealth,
    With power to give them, or to crown with health,
    Our little lot denies.--But Heaven decrees
    To all the gift of minist’ring to ease!
    The gentle offerings of patient love,
    Beyond all flattery, and all praise above;
    The mild forbearance of another’s fault,
    The taunting word suppress’d as soon as thought;
    On these Heaven made the bliss of man depend,
    And crush’d misfortune, when it made a _friend_.
    A solitary blessing few can find:
    Our joys, with those we love, are intertwined.
    And he whose helpful tenderness removes
    Th’ obstructing thorn that wounds the breast he loves,
    Smooths not another’s rugged path alone,
    But scatters roses to adorn his own!

So little resemblance in character was there between Margaret of Anjou,
wife of Henry VI. and her father Renè, King of Sicily and Jerusalem,
that it is related of him, that when the news of the loss of one of
his kingdoms was brought to him, while he was engaged in painting a
partridge from nature, he paid no attention to the communication, nor
would he see the messenger till he had given the finishing strokes
to his design. Renè’s compositions in music, are at this very time
the delight of his native country, and indeed of Europe. He was the
inventor of the Opera ballet; and the drama of _La Tentation_, lately
revived with so much splendour at Paris in 1832, was originally
composed by this Prince. The wild story is his own, and the delightful
melodies his composition, which have been merely tamed and regulated by
modern art. This Prince, adored for his beneficence by his people, who
named him the “_Good_,” was scorned by the destructive nobles of his
era as _fainéant_ and feeble-minded. After the death of his first wife,
Isabella of Lorraine, he married Jeanne de Lovel. She was of so grave
a character, that she was never known to laugh but once, at a pageant
devised by her royal husband--namely, a boat filled with water-pipes,
which played on every side, and completely drenched the spectators
that did not use some agility in getting out of the way.

Margaret’s elder sister, Yolente, survived her two years; she had a
beautiful daughter called Margaret of Anjou the younger. Maria Louisa,
Napoleon’s Empress, possessed the breviary of this Princess, in which
there is one sentence supposed to have been written by the once
beautiful, powerful, and admired Margaret, Queen of England, her aunt:

    “Vanité des vanités, tout est vanité.”

_Speech of a Shawanese Chief to Lord Dunmore._

“I appeal to any white man to-day, if ever he entered Logan’s cabin
hungry, and he gave him not meat; if he ever came cold or naked, and
he gave him not clothing. During the last long and bloody war, Logan
remained idle, ignominious in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such
was my love of the Whites, that those of my own country pointed at me
as I went by, and said, Logan is the friend of white men! I had even
thought to live with you, but the iniquities of one among you did away
that thought, and dragged me from my cabin of peace. Colonel Cressop
the last spring, in cold blood, cut off all the relations of Logan,
sparing neither woman nor child. There runs not a drop of the blood
of Logan in the veins of any human creature. This called on me for
revenge; I have sought it; I have killed many; revenge has been fully
glutted.

“For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace; but harbour not
the thought, that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear; he
will not turn his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for
Logan?--not one.”

Over the petticoat a loose jacket of white cloth, reaching to the knee,
and open in front; its edges and sleeves wrought very tastefully with
red cord. The head dress was composed entirely of money. A fillet of
gold sequins was first put, _à la feronière_, around the forehead, and
a close cap, with a throat piece like the gorget of a helmet, fitted
the skull exactly, stitched with coins of all values, folded over each
other according to their sizes, like scales. The hair was then braided,
and fell down the back, loaded also with money. The greater proportion
of pieces are _paras_, a small and thin Turkish coin of small value.
Among the larger pieces are dollars and coins of all nations. This head
dress often constitutes the marriage portion of the wearer.

between them in the breach: “Are you a gentleman?” demanded Suffolk,
finding it impossible to escape. “I am,” replied Renaud. “But are you
a knight?” rejoined the Earl. “I am not,” answered Renaud. “Kneel

otherwise yield to you.” This was accordingly done, and affords a rich

[Sidenote: The Emperor and the Opera Dancer.]

The insurrection and popular tumult which took place during the first
days of the reign of the present Emperor of Russia, Nicolas, are facts
well known; yet it may not be uninteresting to relate some of the
circumstances attending the substitution of the Grand Duke Nicolas
Paulowitsch in place of his brother the Grand Duke Constantine, who
had abdicated, as was declared, and renounced his right to the crown
in consequence of the marriage which had been in opposition, it was
stated, to the opinions of his family, and by them averred, with his
own abdication of his rights in favour of his brother Nicolas. After
the, to say the least, awfully mysterious death of Alexander, the
Archduke Constantine’s abdication was thus explained.

It was towards the end of 1825 that St. Petersburg was the scene
of the struggle between the subjects and the sovereign; marked, in
the first instance, by the fearless and intrepid exposure of his
own royal person, and in the latter, by the terrible vengeance and
inflictions with which many of the agents of this revolt were made to
suffer by the merciless decree of the new Emperor. Even where life
was spared, scarcely preferable to death were the punishments awarded
indiscriminately, and without mitigation to age, youth, or sex.

Amongst the nobler victims of the Autocrat’s implacable revenge, was
the Prince Troubeitzkoi, a young colonel, but lately married to the
daughter of one of the most distinguished members of the diplomacy at
St. Petersburg. This unfortunate man had sought a refuge in the house
of his father in law; but his retreat being discovered to Nicolas,
he was pursued, and with the trembling ambassador carried before the
Emperor. The Prince Troubeitzkoi, throwing himself on his knees,
implored his clemency, and in tears the wretched parent pleaded his
youth and the sincerity of his repentance. Disdaining to reply to the
prostrate nobleman, Nicolas turned to the ambassador, saying that, in
consideration for him, the life of his son in law was granted, but that
his name would be added to those who were sentenced to the _second_
degree of punishment.

“To lay their head on the block whilst reeking with the blood of their
accomplices, and afterwards to hard labour for life, in exile: that
exile, Siberia!”

Before relating the fate of any of the other conspirators, we will
add to the sad story of this young couple, that the wife sued for and
obtained leave to follow her husband into banishment; she nobly shared
his trials, his privations, and his labours in the mines. Her devotion
had no limit; and it was by the trifling produce of her industry that
she sustained her family. Five times, in these desolate regions, she
became a mother. In the year 1838, she gave her husband a fresh proof
of her sublime and unwearying affection. She quitted Siberia, and alone
crossing the dreadful country, after a journey of _sixteen hundred
leagues_, she threw herself at the feet of the Emperor, and implored
his pardon for her husband.

The autocrat was inflexible, and forbade the name of the individual
who had dared to conspire against his person, to be mentioned in his
presence.

The wretched wife withdrew, and again retrod the desert path to exile
and her husband.

Four years subsequently, this hapless victim again resolved to
undertake this dreadful journey, and to make another effort to soften
the iron will of her sovereign. And this time she succeeded, through
the influence of--_an opera dancer!_

       *       *       *       *       *

Marie Taglioni had by her talent, and her good qualities, acquired the
favour and indulgence of the Emperor and the Empress. Whilst none dared
to speak in behalf of the miserable exiles, or to utter the suppliant’s
cry for mercy, it was suggested, that probably Marie Taglioni would
venture to lay the petition at the Sovereign’s feet; she did so,
and, aided by the noble intercession of the Empress, the pardon was
obtained; and after sixteen years banishment the Prince Troubeitzkoï
was released, but on the condition of never approaching the Russian
territory.

    One evening as I wandered forth

    His face was furrow’d o’er with age,
      And hoary was his hair.

    Oh man! while in thy early years,

      With cares and sorrows worn,
    Then age and want--oh, ill-match’d pair!
      Show man was made to mourn!

      In pleasure’s lap carest,
    Yet think not all the rich and great
      Are likewise truly blest:
    But oh, what crowds in every land
      Are wretched and forlorn!
    Through weary life this lesson learn,
      That man was made to mourn!

    Many and sharp the num’rous ills
      Inwoven with our frame,
    More pointed still we make ourselves,
      Regret, remorse, and shame!
    And man, whose heaven-erected face
      The smiles of love adorn,
    Man’s inhumanity to man,
      Makes countless thousands mourn!

    See yonder poor o’er-labour’d wight,
      So abject, mean, and vile,
    Who begs a brother of the earth
      To give him leave to toil;
    And see his lordly fellow worm
      The poor petition spurn,
    Unmindful though a weeping wife
      And helpless offspring mourn!

    If I’m design’d yon lordling’s slave,
      By nature’s law design’d,
    Why was an independent wish
      E’er planted in my mind?
    If not, why am I subject to
      His cruelty or scorn?
    Or why has man the will and power
      To make his fellow mourn?

    Yet let not this too much, my son,
      Disturb thy youthful breast;
    This partial view of human kind
      Is surely not the best!
    The poor, oppressed, honest man
      Had surely ne’er been born,
    Had there not been some recompense
      To comfort those that mourn!

    Oh Death! the poor man’s dearest friend,
      The kindest and the best,
    Welcome the hour my aged limbs
      Are laid with thee at rest;
    The great, the wealthy fear thy blow,
      From pomp and pleasure torn,
    But oh! a blest relief to those
      Who weary laden mourn!

[Sidenote: Cromwell.]

“Cromwell was formed to delude the minds of men. His hypocrisy, a thing
far removed from what is ordinarily known by that name, was fervent,
and excited sympathy, and created awe in the beholders. The bluntness
of his manner, and the occasional familiarity of his deportment,
even to the entire emptying himself of all extrinsic and accidental
greatness, won the favour of those with whom he had intercourse. There
was something deep in his conceptions, that none of his assistants
could fathom. He was moderate in his temper, and forbearing in his
actions; never allowing himself in violence more frequently, or to a
greater extent, than was necessary to his purposes. Add to which the
firmness and courage of his spirit, and the greatness of his abilities,
whether to procure intelligence, or to overawe the insidiousness and
crooked hostility of foreign courts: and we shall own that he was most
singularly fitted for the station he filled.”[8]

author of the Life of Milton’s Nephews, E. and J. Philips.

[Sidenote: Hyder Ali Khan.]

In the following extract from the speech of the Right Honourable
Edmund Burke, on the subject of the Nabob of Arcot’s debts, the
reader is led by all the enthusiasm of characteristic feeling and the
ornamental graces of imagination which distinguished that orator, to
the contemplation of a great though savage mind, which he so strongly
paints as struggling against the toils of oppressive power, and
in the operation of determined revenge, _collecting, calculating,
and measuring_ the vengeance with which he purposed to visit his
oppressors.

“When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either
would sign no convention, or whom no treaty and no signature could
bind, and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself,
he decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and
predestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved,
in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things, to leave
the whole Carnatick an everlasting monument of vengeance, and to
put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against
whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together,
was no protection. He became at length so confident of his force so
collected in his might, that he made no secret whatsoever of his
dreadful resolution. Having terminated his disputes with every enemy
and every rival, who buried their mutual animosities in their common
detestation against the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from
every quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments
in the arts of destruction; and, compounding all the materials of fury,
havock, and desolation into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the
declivities of the mountains. Whilst the authors of all these evils
were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened
all their horizon, it suddenly burst, and poured down the whole of
its contents upon the plains of the Carnatick. Then ensued a scene of
woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart conceived, and which
no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of war, before known
or heard of, were mercy to that new havock. A storm of universal fire
blasted every field, consumed every house, destroyed every temple. The
miserable inhabitants, flying from their flaming villages, in part were
slaughtered; others, without regard to sex, to age, to the respect of
rank, or sacredness of function, fathers torn from children, husbands
from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the goading
spears of drivers and the trampling of pursuing horses, were swept
into captivity, in an unknown and hostile land. Those who were able to
evade this tempest fled to the walled cities; but, escaping from fire,
sword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine. The alms of the
settlement, in this dreadful exigency, were certainly liberal; and all
was done by charity that private charity could do; but it was a people
in beggary; it was a nation which stretched out its hands for food. For
months together those creatures of sufferance, whose very excess and
luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance
of our austerest fasts, silent, patient, resigned, without sedition or
disturbance, almost without complaint, perished by a hundred a day in
the streets of Madras. Every day seventy at least laid their bodies
in the streets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and expired of famine in
the granary of India. I was going to awake your justice towards this
unhappy part of our fellow citizens, by bringing before you some of the
circumstances of this plague of hunger. Of all the calamities which
beset and waylay the life of man, this comes the nearest to our heart,
and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing
more than he is: but I find myself unable to manage it with decorum;
these details are of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting,
they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the hearers, they are
so humiliating to human nature itself, that, on better thoughts, I
find it more advisable to throw a pall over this hideous object, and
to leave it to your general conceptions. For eighteen months, without
intermission, this destruction raged from the gates of Madras to the
gates of Tanjore; and so completely did these masters in their art,
Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious son, absolve themselves of their
impious vow, that when the British armies traversed, as they did, the
Carnatick for hundreds of miles in all directions, through the whole
line of their march they did not see one man, not one woman, not one
child, not one four-footed beast of any description whatever. One dead,
uniform silence reigned over the whole region. With the inconsiderable
exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few forts, (I wish to be
understood as speaking literally; I mean to produce to you more than
three witnesses, above all exception, who will support this assertion
in its full extent) that hurricane of war passed through every part of
the central provinces of the Carnatick. Six or seven districts to the
North and to the South (and these not wholly untouched) escaped the
general ravage.

[Sidenote: Pride of Birth.]

It is the present fashion to consider the pride of descent as an
empty pretension, but it cannot be denied that it is a pretension
which has been regarded in every country, in all ages. There are many
sound philosophical arguments in favour of a regard to birth, which
pretenders to deeper reasoning do not appear to be aware of. It is a
counteraction to the undue influence of wealth and mere brutal power.
It is impossible to prevent the accumulation of wealth in the basest of
the people, at least in a free country! The easiest paths to wealth are
the meanest and least virtuous. However, the most current opinion is
that _wealth is wealth_, and that he who can spend the most is the most
important man; and that it is idle and childish to pay any attention as
to how and whence he got it. But true aristocracy knows its own place,
and holds firm to it; and various are the effects it has on the mind
which cannot be analysed by language. It has a tendency to create a
lofty sort of sentiment, rather than a low and selfish gratification,
as the guide of the thoughts and the conduct. It would find a thousand
ideal comforts in adversity and obscurity, which new families, thrown
back into poverty, cannot command.

James II. of England married the Princess Maria d’Este, the sister of
Francis, Duke of Modena, who was as beautiful as she was unfortunate.
The Queen having been married some time without having children, when
this event did take place, malice, falsehood, envy, and intrigue were
active in declaring the heir thus born to be “a supposititious Prince
of Wales.” This tissue of forgery and falsehood still farther tended
to affect the popularity of the king, and bring his person and throne
into disrepute. However, upon the whole mass and evidence of history
that is presented, the only conclusion to be drawn was this, and only
this, that the Prince of Wales, so far from being “supposititious,” was
royally and legally born the lawful successor of his father’s throne
and realms.

George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, the dissolute favourite

    “A man so various, that he seem’d to be,
    Not one, but all mankind’s epitome:
    Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,
    His every thing by starts, and nothing long:
    But in the course of one revolving moon,
    Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon.
    In squandering wealth was his peculiar art,
    Nothing went unrewarded, but desert:
    Beggar’d by fools, when still he found too late,
    He had his jest, and they--had his estate.”

At the time of King Charles’s death, he went into the country, and
on the 16th of April, 1688, he died at a servant’s house at Rickby
Meerside, from a cold caught by sitting on the ground after fox-hunting.

Pope in his Epistle to Lord Bathurst, thus alludes to his death.

    “In the worst inn’s worst room, with mat half hung,
    The floors of plaister, and the walls of dung;
    On once a flock bed, but repaired with straw,
    With tape tied curtains, never meant to draw;
    The George and Garter dangling from that bed,
    Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red,
    Great Villiers lies. Alas! how chang’d from him,

To the High and Mighty Servant of the most powerful Prince George,
  King of Great Britain, his most lowly and humble slave comes praying
  for mercy for the father of her children.

  Most mighty Sir,

May the blessing of thy God ever await thee!

May the sun of glory shine round thy head!

May the gates of plenty, honour, and happiness be always open to thee
and thine!

May no sorrows distress thy days!

May no grief disturb thy nights!

May the pillow of peace kiss thy cheek!

The pleasures of imagination attend thy dreams!

And when length of time makes thee tired of earthly joys, and the
curtain of death gently closes round the last sleep of human existence,

May the angels of thy God attend thy bed, and take care that thy
expiring lamp of life shall not receive one wide blast to hasten its
extinction.

O! hearken to the voice of distress,

And grant the petition of thy servant:

Spare, oh! spare the father of my children, the partner of my bed, my
husband, my all that’s dear.

Consider, oh! consider, he did not become what he is by iniquity,
and that what he possesses was the inheritance of a long line of
flourishing ancestors,

Who, in those smiling days, when the intruders of Great Britain were
not heard of in the fertile plains of Indostan, reaped their harvest in
quiet, and enjoyed their patrimony unmolested.

Think, oh! think, that the God whom thou worshippest delighteth not in
the blood of the innocent; remember thy own commandment, “_Thou shalt
not kill_,” and obey the order of Heaven.

Give me back my Almas Ali Cawn, and take all our wealth.

Strip us of our jewels and precious stones, of our gold and silver, but
take not away the life of my husband.

Innocence is sealed on his brow,

And the milk of human kindness flows round his heart.

Let us wander through the deserts, let us become tillers and labourers
on the delightful spot of which he was once the master:

But spare, oh! mighty Sir, spare his life!

Let not the instrument of death be lifted against him, for he has
committed _no crime_.

Accept those treasures from gratitude, which at present thou takest by
force; we will remember thee in our prayer, and forget we were once
rich and powerful.

My children, the children of my Almas Ali, send up their petitions for
the life of him who gave them life.

They beseech from thee the author of their existence.

By that humanity we are told glows in the breasts of Europeans;

By the tender mercy of enlightened souls of Englishmen;

By the honour, virtue, and maternal affection of thy great Queen,

Whose numerous offspring are so dear to her; the miserable wife of thy
prisoner beseeches thee to save her husband’s life, and restore him to
her arms.

Thy God will reward thee:

_They_ will thank thee:

And the now petitioning, will pray for thee, if thou grantest the
prayer of thy humble vassal

in great splendour, a vast concourse of foreign princes and valiant
knights flocked from all parts of the world to his court; the king,
unwilling to create controversies amongst his noble guests, by seeming
to give precedence to one more than another, caused an immense round
table to be erected in the great hall at Winchester, where he then held
his court, at which it was so managed that no person could take place

it into an order of knighthood, dignifying the knights whom he chose

    Eternal Mover, whose diffused glory
      To shew our groveling reason what thou art,
    Infoldes itself in cloudes of restless story,
      Where man (the proudest creature) acts his parte;
    Whom yett, alas! I know not why, we call
    The world’s contracted sunn, the little all.

    For what are wee, but lumpes of walking clay?
      What are our vaunts? whence should our spirits rise?
    Are not brute beasts as strong, and birds as gay;
      Trees longer liv’d, and creeping thinges as wise?
    Onlie our Soules recieve more inward light,
    To feel our weakness, and confess thy might.

    Lett these pure noates ascend unto thie throne,
      Where majestie doth sitt with mercy crown’d;
    Where my redeemer lives, in whome alone
      The errors of my wandringe life are drown’d.
    Where all the quire of heaven resound thi fame,
    That none but thine, thine is the saving name.

    Therefore my Soule, Joye in the midst of paine,
      That Christ, that conquer’d Hell, shall from above
    With greater triumphs yett returne againe,
      And conquer his own justice with his love;
    Commandinge earth and Seas to render those
    Unto his bliss, for whome hee pay’d his woes.

    Nowe have I doune, now are my joies at peace,
      And now my joies are stronger than my griefe;
    I feele those comforts that shall never cease,
      Future in hopes, but present in reliefe.
    Thy words are true, thy promises are just,
    And thou wilt knowe thy marked flock in dust.

    Enthral the crimson stomacher;
    A cuffe neglectful, and thereby
    Ribbands to fly confusedly:
    A winning wave (deserving note)

    A careless shoe-string, in whose tye,

        Go, empty joys,
        With all your noise,
    And leave me here alone,
    In sad sweet silence to bemoan
    The fickle worldly height,
    Whose danger none can see aright
    Whilst your false splendors dim the sight.

        Go, and ensnare,
        With your trim ware,
    Some other worldly wight,
    And cheat him with your flattering sight!
    Rain on his head a shower
    Of honour, greatness, wealth, and power,
    Then snatch it from him in an hour.

        Fill his big mind
        With gallant wind
    Of insolent applause;
    Let him not fear the curbing laws,
    Nor king, nor people’s frown;
    But dream on something like a crown,
    Then, climbing upwards, tumble down!

        Let him appear
        In his bright sphere
    Like Cynthia in her pride,
    With star-like troops on every side;
    For number and clear light,
    Such as may soon o’erwhelm him quite,
    And blind them both in one dead night!

        Welcome, sad night,
        Grief’s sole delight!
    Thy mourning best agrees
    With honor’s funeral obsequies.
    In Thetis’ lap he lies,
    Mantled with soft securities,
    When too much sun light dims his eyes.

        Was he too bold
        Who needs would hold
    With curbing reins to sway,
    And make Sol’s fiery steeds obey?
    Therefore as rash was I,
    Who with ambitious wings did fly
    In _Charles’s Waine_ too hastily!

        I fall! I fall!
        Whom shall I call?
    Alas! shall I be heard,
    Who now am neither lov’d nor fear’d?
    You, who have vow’d the ground
    To kiss, where my blest steps were found,
    Come, catch me at my last rebound!

        Now each admires
        Heaven’s twinkling fires,
    Whilst from their glorious seat,
    Their influence gives light and heat.
    But oh! how few there are,
    (Though danger from the act be far,)
    Will run to catch a falling star!

        O! wer’t our fate
        To imitate
    Those lights, whose pallidness
    Argues no inward quietness!
    Their course is one way bent,
    Which is the course, there’s no dissent
    In Heaven’s High Court of Parliament.

Every year steals away something from us. In one we lose a relation,
in the next a friend; health grows more precarious, and pleasure less
alluring, till by degrees the whole little mass of happiness we had
been gathering drops from us insensibly, and that grave, which we had
once looked on with so much horror, becomes at last our refuge and
shelter.

    When fate relentless makes the good man die,
    Why flows the bitter tear, why heaves the sigh?
    Short is his passage to the realms of rest,
    O! then, how selfish ’tis to mourn the blest!
    Lamented _father_! how few can truly feel
    The ardent charity, the friendly zeal
    That strove in thee, through life, with active power:
    And more--that hope, which cheer’d thy parting hour.
    To know thee thus, we dry the falling tear,
    And ill-timed sorrow were unseemly here:
    The mortal yields to God his parting breath;
    The Christian’s soul’s great triumph is in death.

    Here on the cold clear Egla’s breezy side
      My hand amid her ringlets wont to rove,
    She proffered now the lock, and now denied,
      With all the baby playfulness of love.
    Here the false maid with many an artful tear,
      Made me each rising thought of doubt discover;
    And vowed, and wept, till hope had ceased to fear,
      Ah me! beguiling like a child her lover.
    One evening, on the river’s pleasant strand,
      The maid, too well beloved, sat with me,
    And with her finger traced upon the sand
      Death for Diana--not inconstancy.
    And Love beheld us from his secret stand,
      And marked his triumph, laughing to behold me;
    To see me trust a writing traced in sand;
      To see me credit what a woman told me.

[Sidenote: Phrenology.]

Those ingenious gentlemen, the metaphysicians, who have enlightened the
world by explaining away the fundamental doctrines of religion, and
the principles of human actions and convictions, among other startling
discoveries, have introduced a theory on good and evil actions,
exceedingly applicable, comfortable, and welcome to all mankind; as it
does away with conscience and duty, and makes virtue and vice affairs
of physical temperament or organization--in other words, that a man’s
merit or demerit is not, as they hold, to be estimated by his deeds,
but by the amount of inclination with which he commits them. Men,
according to those philosophers, are born with particular inclinations,
which lead them insensibly and directly to particular vices or virtues,
or, with some peculiar organizations, to all the vices or all the
virtues. By this reasoning it appears that it is as difficult for one
man to commit a certain crime, as for another to forbear; and, as
a natural consequence, that since a man is not accountable for his
inclination, the guilt incurred by committing it, is of very unequal
account; and that if a man be not praiseworthy for abstaining from a
crime towards which he has no inclination, neither is a man blameable
for committing it, if he is strongly inclined to it. Nature, not
man, ought to be blamed or commended; and the being able to lay the
sin of vice or crime to the account of organization, will materially
facilitate the completion of it.

[Sidenote: Christina, Queen of Sweden.]

In the year 1657, these walls (Fontainebleau) were polluted by a crime
which had no parallel in the records of modern times. The murder of
Monaldeschi, and all its particulars, as related so naïvely by Le Père
Lobel, are too well known to make it necessary to detail them: but the
letter that the haughty Christina wrote to the minister Mazarin, when
the king’s displeasure was signified by him to her, is less frequently
quoted. It is a masterpiece of effrontery and insolence; yet, a
fortnight after receiving it, both the king and cardinal paid a solemn
visit of reconciliation to the royal murderess.


_Letter of Christina, Queen of Sweden to Cardinal Mazarin._

  “Monsieur Mazarin,

“Those who have detailed to you the affair of Monaldeschi, my equerry,
were very ill-informed. I think it strange that you should compromise
so many people in order to inform yourself of a fact which does not
concern you. I ought not to be astonished at your conduct, however
absurd it may be; but I could have scarcely credited, that either you
or your proud young master, would have dared to exhibit towards me any
marks of resentment.

“Learn, all of you, valets and masters, great and little, that it was
my pleasure to act as I have done: and that I neither am obliged, nor
will render an account of my actions to anybody, be they who they may;
above all, to a _braggadocio_ like you. You give yourself singular airs
for a personage of your rank; but whatever reasons you may have had to
write to me, I do not care enough about them to concern myself on the
subject for a single instant. I desire you to know, and to repeat it
to whomsoever it may concern, that Christina is totally indifferent
to the opinion of your court, and still less to yours; that I have no
occasion, in order to compass my own vengeance, to have recourse to
your formidable power.

“My honour required what was done; my will is a law which it is your
part to respect: to be silent is your duty; and there are many persons
for whom I have no more regard than for yourself, who would do well
to learn how to conduct themselves towards their equals, before they
venture to make more disturbances than is requisite.

“Know further, Monsieur le Cardinal, that Christina is a Queen,
wherever she may chance to reside; and in whatever place it is her
pleasure to live, the persons who surround her, cheats, though they may
be, are better than you and your confederates. The Prince de Condé
was right, when he exclaimed, at the time when you kept him prisoner
so inhumanly, at Vincennes, ‘This old fox will never cease to outrage
all the good friends of the state, until, at last, the parliament shall
turn off, or severely punish, this illustrious rascal of _Piscena_.’
Take my advice then, Jules; conduct yourself in a manner to merit my
favour; it is a study to which you cannot too much apply. God preserve
you from ever daring to utter the least word against me; for, were I
at the other end of the world, I should be aware of your proceedings.
I have friends and courtiers in my service, who are as adroit and as
watchful as any you can boast of, although they may not be so well
bribed.”

    Nor he for friendship can the thought unfit,
    That strives his manners should precede his wit.

    If I would wish for truth, and not for show,
    The aged Saturn’s age, and rites to know;
    If I would strive to bring back times, and try
    The world’s pure gold, and wise simplicity,
    If I would virtue set, as she was young,
    And hear her speak with one and her first tongue;
    If holiest friendship naked to the touch
    I would restore, and keep it ever such,
    I need no other arts but study thee,
    Who prov’st all these were, and again may be.

[Sidenote: King of Prussia’s Guard.]

When Frederick the Great was forming his Regiment of Royal Guards, it
is said, that the monarch was so anxious to obtain tall men, that his
corporals often took them by force, wherever they could find them. On
one occasion they carried the wish of their sovereign so far, that they
took the “heyduc” of the French ambassador, the moment he had quitted
his carriage to attend the levee. However, on a complaint from the
ambassador, the servant was restored to his master.


It is also related of this ambassador, that on his first audience he
came highly perfumed; the great Frederick, who was more accustomed
to the smell of gunpowder than of musk, could not refrain from very
visibly showing his dislike. The ambassador observed it, and felt
much embarrassed. The day being stormy, “De quel côté, sa Majesté
croit-elle,” said he, “que le vent vient?” The king abruptly replied,
“De France, votre Excellence.”

Benvenuto Cellini arrived in France in 1537, but, offended by the
cold reception of Il Rosso,[13] he resolved, notwithstanding the
_gracious welcome_ of Francis I. to return to Italy almost immediately,
where he was imprisoned in the castle of St. Angelo. By the generous
intervention of Francis, he was at length released, and returned to
France, where he was most royally provided for; nevertheless, his
pride, and jealousy of Primatice, kept him in constant agitation,
and at length wearied out the king, whose inclination was always
obliged to yield to his caprice; and at last he abandoned the greatest
advantages which ever were offered to an artist, and quitted France
for ever--a step he never ceased to regret. On one occasion, he went
to St. Germains with a vase of silver-gilt, destined for the Duchesse
d’Etampes, and was so irritated at the loss of time which he was
obliged to submit to before he could be admitted to her presence, that
he hurried away, and in the height of his indignation offered the vase
to the Cardinal de Lorraine as a present.

Another instance of his furious temper is sufficiently remarkable. He
tells, in his confessions, that one of his models, a beautiful French
girl, named Catherine, who sat to him for thirty sous a day, having
offended him, “Giving way entirely to my rage, I seized her by the
hair, and dragged her about the room, _kicking and beating her till
I was quite fatigued_. She swore she never would come near me again;
but the next morning at day-break, she came, threw herself on my neck,
covered me with kisses, and asked if _I was still angry with her_.”

All that has been written in song, or told in story, of love and its
effects, falls far short of its reality. Its evils and its blessings,
its impotence and its power, its sin and its holiness, its weakness
and its strength, will continue the theme of nature and of art,
until the great pulse of the universe is stilled. Arising from the
depths of misery, descending from heaven the most direct and evident
manifestation of a divine and self-sacrificing spirit, it is at once
the tyrant and the slave. Happier as the latter than as the former, for
the perfection of love is obedience; the power of obeying what we love
is, at all events, the perfection of a woman’s happiness.

_Arms of the House of Medici._

“The house of Medici,” says the author of the Discours merveilleux sur
la Vie de Catherine de Medici, “was for a long period hidden amongst
the lowest refuse of the people at Florence. It began to rise by means
of a collier, who had a son an apothecary, _who took the name of his
profession_; and as we in the present day see people taking for devices
the emblems of their trade, as tailors their scissors, masons their
hammer or trowel, so this doctor adopted _five pills_, as it is their
habit to order an odd number to their patients.” This is a singular
derivation of the armorial bearings of this celebrated house.

[Sidenote: Scenes from the Life of Michael Angelo.]

In the year 1474, on Monday the 6th of March, at four o’clock in the
morning, was born at the castle of Caprese, in the territory of Areggo,
Michael Angelo, son of Ludovico de Lionardo de Buonarotti, Governor
of Chiusi and of Caprese, and descended from one of the most ancient
families of Tuscany.

Although at this period of Florentine history commerce and trade were
considered as most honourable pursuits, and indeed to these were
ascribed the great power and riches of the state, the father of the
little Michael Angelo destined him for his own profession, and already
foresaw him a future Governor, nay Ambassador; far from thinking that
he was destined to become what he contemptuously termed a mason! But
there is a destiny attached to the life of celebrated men; and fate
selected for Michael, as his nurse, the wife of a stonemason, and
whilst the child throve under her care, and grew strong and robust
in the sun and air, his infant hands, hardened by exposure, grasped
the chisel and the hammer, and his first cries mingled with the harsh
grating of the saw.

It was in vain that the proud parent sought to dissuade the boy, and
curb the only inclination he manifested: even at school he contrived
to escape the vigilance of the master, and obtained the notice of the
artist Ghirlandajo, who said of him, “He is a rising star, that will
live to eclipse the brightest planet now shining.” He was even induced
to seek Michael’s father, and beseeching him not to oppose the manifest
vocation of his son, offered to take him as an apprentice to his art.
At this proposal, the Podesta started from his chair in a paroxysm of
rage; but after a while he calmly went to a desk, wrote an engagement
on the behalf of his son for three years, and with an expression of
countenance little less affecting than that with which Brutus signed
the death warrant of his son, handed him over to Ghirlandajo. With
one bound Michael cleared the staircase, throwing up his cap for joy.
He burnt his grammar: true, he was not much more than a servant at
Ghirlandajo’s; but what did that matter? he was free to pursue his own
tastes, he was happier than a Medicis! He could now bedaub the walls as
he chose, he could grind his colours, sketch, or if a morsel of plaster
fell in his way, he could mould it to his will, without fearing to have
his ears pulled.

Before he had attained the age of thirteen, he was already a great
artist, and his success had naturally created jealousy and enmity. A
blow from Torregiano, when they as boys worked together, broke the
cartilage of the nose, and disfigured that feature for life.

On the other hand, Michael Angelo could not fail to find as many
friends, and amongst the most celebrated of the age. Benvenuto Cellini,
whose great genius and talents ranked with those of Buonarotti, was
his most ardent admirer, and never designated him but as the “divine
Buonarotti.”

During the _boy_ artist’s wanderings in the gardens of the Medici
palace, he often met some of the stone cutters who had formerly rocked
his cradle: they were ever delighted to see him, and frequently
obtained him clandestinely a view of the treasures of the gallery,
then in its infancy. Michael Angelo contemplated with veneration the
mutilated specimens of art. The workmen one day offered him a bit of
marble, requesting he would employ it as he liked, and come thither as
often as he chose.

His only answer was to grasp a chisel, throw off his jacket, and begin
to hammer out the outline of a Faun’s head. Often then was the workshop
deserted, to the great displeasure of the master. One day, whilst
putting the finishing strokes to his old Faun, a man about forty years
of age, plain in person and shabbily attired, stopped, and silently
watched him as he worked. Michael Angelo continued to work on, heeding
him no more than the dust which fell from his chisel. When he had given
the last touch, he drew back, as artists are wont, to look on the
effect of the head. For this, probably the silent observer had waited,
for he slowly approached, and, putting his hand on the young artist’s
shoulder, “My friend,” he said smiling, “with your leave, I would make
an observation.”

Michael Angelo turned quickly, and with an air somewhat impertinent and
caustic, replied, “An observation!--you!”

“A criticism, if you prefer it.”

“Upon my Faun’s head?”

“Upon your Faun’s head.”

“And, who are you, Sir, who fancy you have a right to criticise my
work?”

“It matters not to you who I am, provided my criticism is just.”

“And who will decide, Sir, which of us two is in the right?”

“I will leave the decision to yourself.”

“Well, Sir, speak,” said Michael Angelo, crossing his arms with an air
of defiance.

“Was it not your object to make an _old_ Faun laughing immoderately?”

“Undoubtedly, it is easy to be discovered.”

“Well then,” said the critic, “where did you ever see old men with all
their teeth perfect?”

The boy blushed to his eyes, and bit his lip. The observation was
correct. He only waited till the individual had turned his back, when
with one stroke of his chisel he knocked out two of the Faun’s teeth,
and even decided on hollowing out the gum on returning next day. The
gardens accordingly were no sooner opened than Michael Angelo entered;
but the Faun had disappeared, and in its place stood the person he had
seen the preceding day.

“What is become of my head?” asked the young sculptor angrily.

“It has been removed by my command,” replied the stranger, with his
accustomed apathy.

“And who are you, Sir, who dare to give orders in the gardens of the
great Medicis?”

“Follow me, and you shall learn!”

“I will follow, to force you to restore me my Faun.”

“Perhaps you will be better satisfied to leave it where it is.”

“We shall see.”

“We shall see,” echoed the stranger, and then took the path to the
palace, with the same calm demeanour; but on his beginning to ascend
the staircase, the boy, seemingly terrified as well as angry, caught
his arm, saying, “Where are you going, Sir? You are approaching the
apartments of the Prince, and although he may look over an intrusion in
the royal gardens, we here run great risk.”

On, proceeded the stranger, the servants rising as he approached, the
guards saluting.

Michael was lost in wonder. Even supposing him one of the household (he
thought to himself), my Faun belongs to me, and he ought to restore it:
my labour is my own, and I can pay him for the marble.

The galleries, the saloons were passed through without interruption.
Good Heaven! thought the boy, it must be at least the secretary, whom
I have thus cavalierly treated.

The stranger threw open the door of a room magnificently furnished,
and enriched with all most valuable in art; and the trembling child
considered himself as lost, when he remembered his treatment of one
powerful enough to be able to approach Lorenzo de Medicis without being
announced. Whilst he was stammering out an apology, he raised his eyes,
and saw his old Faun placed on a superb bracket.

“You see, my friend,” said the stranger, with the same mild and kind
manner, “that if I had your Faun removed from the garden, it was to
place it in a more suitable situation.”

“But, my God!” cried the youthful artist, “what will the Prince say,
when he discovers this poor attempt amongst so many precious works?”

The Prince held out his hand, “Take it, my friend.”

Any other than Michael Angelo would have thrown himself at his feet;
but he burst into tears, and, bowing his head, convulsively pressed the
hand offered him by Lorenzo the Magnificent. “Henceforward thou art
here at home, my friend; thou wilt work here, dine at my table, and I
shall treat you as one of my children. Go to my wardrobe, and desire
that they give thee a rich cloak of velvet; velvet, exactly like those
worn by Peter and John de Medicis, on days of ceremony.”

“My Lord,” replied the boy, deeply affected, “suffer me first to go
to my father, that he may share my happiness. He turned me from his
roof as a disobedient and worthless child, and I would return thither
a submissive and devoted man. I know my father to be as just as he is
inflexible, and he will admit that I have a right to be proud of my
disobedience. From this day I may carry my head high; for Lorenzo de
Medicis, the first man of the age, has consecrated me an artist.”

“Right, my child; and you may also tell your father, that my patronage
will extend to all your family. This very day I will receive him at
the palace, and bestow on him any appointment in Florence that may be
suited to him.”

Old Buonarotti was quietly breakfasting in his room, which he had
scarcely left since he had lost his son, when loud and repeated
knocking at the door nearly drove it from its hinges. The Governor
hastened to open it himself, but drew back at the sight of Michael
Angelo, whom he did not immediately recognize.

Pale, breathless, his head bare, his dress in disorder, covered with
dust and plaster, the boy made a spring from the door to throw himself
into his father’s arms.

“Begone!” cried the Governor, trembling with passion.

“Father, father, hear me, I implore, before you thus drive me from you.
Listen to me but for one moment.”

“You would then force me to curse you.”

“I come from the palace.”

“I neither wish to know whence you come, or what you do. I had once a
son called Michael Angelo. He was to have been (at least, I hoped so)
the glory, the support of my family, the joy, the comfort of my old
age, but I have lost this ungrateful and disobedient son--thank God, he
is no longer here, I sold him to the sculptor Ghirlandajo for eighteen
florins.”

“For my mother’s sake, hear me! behold me at your feet.”

“Back to your mason’s, that is your place.”

“My place!” said Michael Angelo, rising proudly from his knees,
“_my_ place is in the apartment of princes; my place is amongst the
first artists of Florence; my place is at the table of Lorenzo the
Magnificent.”

“My God, my God, he is mad!” exclaimed the poor father, passing from
rage to terror.

“But follow me, father, follow me, and you will see that the great
Lorenzo has taken me by the hand, that he has placed me in his palace,
that he expects you, that he offers you an employment, according to
your choice.”

The old Buonarotti was perfectly upset; he held his head between his
hands, and asked of himself which had lost his reason, his son or
himself. Michael Angelo not allowing him farther time for reflection,
dragged him by force to the palace of the great Medicis. The Governor
believed himself to be in a dream. No guard forbade their approach, and
the courtiers drew respectfully back to give them passage.

At the door of the Prince’s closet, a page raised the hanging curtain,
and the old Buonarotti stood with his son in the presence of the
Medicis.

“Sir,” said the Prince, coming forward and courteously addressing him,
“I have been the cause of disturbing you, in order to ask your leave
that I may retain about me a son of whom you may be justly proud, and
who bids fair to become the first artist of his time. My house shall be
his home, and his salary you will yourself name.

“In return, I make you only one request; your son has probably already
told you what. It is that you ask of me any appointment most suitable
to your taste and habits. It is granted beforehand.”

“My son,” replied the agitated father, endeavouring to master his
emotion, “will, I think, be paid beyond his deserts, if he receives
five ducats monthly.”

“And for yourself, Sir?”

“For myself, Prince, I ask a trifling situation now vacant in the
customs: it can only be given to a citizen of the State; I ask it,
because it is a post I feel I can fill with honour.”

“You will never be rich, my dear Buonarotti,” laughingly replied the
Medicis, “for, offered any situation you please, you content yourself
with a little place in the customs.”

“Enough too--for the father of a _mason_!”

And thus was Michael Angelo de Buonarotti introduced to the patronage
of the illustrious Medicis.

[Sidenote: Of Bees.]

It is easy to imagine why they are highly valued. They have always been
very numerous in Palestine. Frequent mention is made in the sacred
volume of “honey out of the rock.” The Scriptures also speak of honey
as forming a part of the presents which it was usual to send to persons
of distinction. Canaan is described as a land “flowing with milk and
honey.” John the Baptist is said to have lived upon “locusts and wild
honey,” and among the articles of food set before our Saviour, when,
after his resurrection he ate with his disciples, was a piece of an
“honeycomb.”

These combined circumstances have doubtless had their share in leading
the uninstructed, in nearly all countries and times, to look upon the
Bee with a feeling of superstitious reverence.

_Mead_, the produce of the Bee, was the favourite drink, the nectar of
the ancient Britons; and their attachment to this extraordinary little
insect ascended to a very remote period. According to their belief,
the high origin of the Bee is from Paradise, and it was on account of
man’s transgression they left it, and then God gave them a blessing.
The priests therefore maintained that no _Mass_ ought to be celebrated,
except by the light of _wax_.

These extraordinary little insects make the tops and bottoms of
their cells of three planes meeting in a point, and the inclinations
or angles at which they meet, are precisely those found out by the
mathematicians to be the best possible for saving wax and work. Who
could dream the Bee was conversant with the highest branch of the
mathematics, the fruit of Newton’s most wonderful labour, of the
source of which he was himself ignorant; one of his most celebrated
followers having found it out in a later age? This little insect works
with a truth and correctness which are perfect, and according to the
principles at which man has arrived only after ages of slow improvement
in the most difficult branch of the most difficult science. But the
mighty and all-wise Creator who made the insect and the philosopher,
bestowing reason on the latter, and giving skill to the former to work
without it, to Him all truths are known from all eternity with an
intuition that mocks even the conceptions of the sagest of human kind.

[Sidenote: Oliver Cromwell.]

It is related by Pope, and also by Spencer in his Anecdotes, that
on the night after the decollation of King Charles I. his body was
placed in a room at Whitehall, and that the Earl of Southampton sat in
the room to guard and manifest his respect to the royal corse. About
midnight the door opened, and a person so muffled that he could not
be known entered; who, after slowly walking to the coffin, looked at
the corse some time, and having exclaimed “Cruel necessity!” as slowly
retired. Lord Southampton imagined from the figure and voice, that it
was Oliver Cromwell!

Supposing this to be the case, it were only consistent with the
hypocrisy of his character, that he should assume the appearance of
feeling, in order to impress people with a character for humanity.


It is remarked in Walpoliana as a singular fact, that the descendants
of Charles I. and Oliver Cromwell intermarried in the fourth degree

Placing them together for the sake of expedition, he devoured them

[Sidenote: Duke of Monmouth.]

Arguments in favour of the belief that the Duke of Monmouth was
_not_ executed, as declared, but suffered to escape; an individual
who was under sentence of death having been induced to pass for this
unfortunate prince.

Hume says, Après son exécution ses partisans conservaient l’espérance
de le revoir à leur tête; ils se flattèrent que le prisonnier qu’on
avait exécuté n’était pas le Duc de Monmouth, mais qu’un de ses amis,
qui lui ressemblait beaucoup, avait eu le courage de mourir pour lui.

Sainte Foix, in a letter on the subject of the “Masque de Fer,”
dated Amsterdam, 1768, says, “Il est certain que le bruit courut dans
Londres qu’un officier de l’armée de Monmouth, qui lui ressemblait
beaucoup, fait prisonnier et sûr d’être condamné au mort, avait reçu la
proposition de passer pour lui avec autant de joie que si on lui avait
accordé la vie, et que, sur ce bruit, une grande dame, ayant gagné ceux
qui pouvaient ouvrir son cercueil, et lui ayant regardé le bras droit,
s’écria, ‘Ah! ce n’est pas le Duc de Monmouth!’”

Enfin, Sainte-Foix, qui cherche à prouver que le Masque de Fer n’était
autre que le Duc de Monmouth, cite un passage d’un ouvrage par Pyms,
et dans lequel on dit, “Le Comte Danby envoya chercher le Colonel
Skelton, qui avait eu ci-devant la Lieutenance de la Tour de Londres,
et à qui le Prince d’Orange l’avait otée pour la donner au Lord Lucas.
‘Skelton,’ lui dit le Comte Danby, ‘hier au soir en soupant avec
Robert Johnston, vous lui dites, que le Duc de Monmouth était vivant
et enfermé dans quelque chateau en Angleterre.’ ‘Je n’ai point affirmé
cela, puisque je n’en sais rien,’ dit Skelton, ‘mais j’ai dit, que,
la nuit d’après la prétendue exécution du Duc de Monmouth, le Roi,
accompagné de trois hommes, vint lui-même le tirer de la Tour, et que
le Duc fut emmené par lui.”

Sainte-Foix cite encore une conversation du père Tournemine, et ajoute:

“La Duchesse de Portsmouth dit au père Tournemine et au Confesseur du
Roi Jacques, qu’elle reprocherait toujours à la mémoire de ce Prince
l’exécution du Duc de Monmouth après que Charles Second, à l’heure de
la mort, et prêt à communier devant l’hostie, que Haldeston prêtre
catholique avait secrètement apportée, avait fait promettre au Roi
Jacques (alors Duc d’York), que quelque revolte, que quant au Duc de
Monmouth, il ne le ferait jamais punir de mort. _Aussi le Roi Jacques
ne l’a-t-il pas fait mourir_, repondit le père Sanders.”

Strange, that we can live so constantly with that threatening hand hung
over us, and not think of it always! How difficult it is to realise
death! how difficult to believe that the hand with whose every vein you
are familiar will ever lose its motion and warmth! That the quick eye
will settle and grow dull. It is at first hard to believe that we _must
die_; harder still to believe the repulsive circumstances that follow
this terrible change! It is a bitter thought, at the lightest. There
is little comfort in knowing that the sense and the mind, that feel
and measure suffering, will be gone. The separation of soul and body is
too great a mystery to satisfy fear: it is the body that we know; it is
this material frame in which the affections have grown up. The spirit
is a thought, a presence, that we are told of, but do not see. The idea
of existence is connected indissolubly with the visible body, and its
pleasant and familiar scenes. We talk of, and rest our belief on the
soul’s ascent to its Maker; but it is not ourselves, it is not our own
conscious breathing identity, that we, in imagination, send up through
the invisible air; we do not understand, we cannot realise the wondrous
thought.

[Sidenote: Origin of the Title of Earl.]

During the government of the Anglo-Saxons _Earldoms_ of counties were
not merely dignities of honour, but officers of justice; each person
having the charge and custody of the county of which he was Earl; and
for their assistance in the discharge of this duty, they had also
deputies, or _vicecomes_, as they were denominated, appointed, which
office still continues to be executed by the Sheriffs annually chosen
for the different counties of England and Wales. The _Earls_, in
recompense for their travelling expenses, and other charges incidental
to the affairs of this important office, had originally a salary
derived from the profits of the third penny of the county[14] granted
to them; and this custom continued for a long time after the conquest,
and was formerly inserted as a princely benevolence in their patents of
creation. These salaries were at a later period changed into pensions
for the better support of their dignity, as appears by many ancient
records. The word Earl, by the Saxons was called _Erlig_, or Ethling;
by the Germans, _Grave_, as Landgrave, Margrave, &c. and by the Dutch,
Eorle: but upon the conquest of England by William, Duke of Normandy,
in 1066, and the subsequent settlement of the Normans in this country
they were called _Comes_, or _Comites_, and for consequence in State
affairs were usually styled _Comes Illustres_. Formerly Kings were
addressed by the title of _Your Grace_. Henry VIII. was the first, says
Houssaie, who assumed the title of _Highness_; and at length _Majesty_.
It was Francis I. who began to give him this last title, in their
interview in the year 1520.

[Sidenote: Voltaire.]

Those who proclaim Voltaire to be an atheist, only evince their
ignorance of his real sentiments, and the beautiful principle by which
he was influenced; his every act tended to acquit him of the charge
of atheism. Besides, it never did, never can exist! Were it possible
our lips could deny this truth, our hearts must witness to it; and
however strongly the wretched atheist would assert the nonexistence
of the power he denies, the very faculties, the reasoning, the subtle
arguments which he employs, are these not so many attributes derived
from a power, Almighty, though indefinite, Omnipresent, though
invisible? The command of language, the superiority of talent he
proudly displays, give the lie to his own system; whilst common sense
declares beyond all doubt, the existence of that wonderful chain
of creation, of which man is the first link, formed by a Divine
intelligence, foreseeing and pre-ordaining all things. Alas! it must be
admitted, that Voltaire denied the _Divinity_ of our Saviour, although
his virtues were those of a Christian; so often evinced in acts of
the purest benevolence and philanthropy, rejecting all sectarian
intolerance, affecting no uncharitable jargon. How to be regretted that
such virtues were not guided and supported by belief!

Happy they who rely on the eternity of the soul, who believe as the
loved fall, one after one, from their side, that they have returned
to their native country, that they await the Divine reunion; who feel
that each treasure of knowledge they attain, they carry with them
through illimitable being; who see in virtue the essence of the element
of that world they are to inhabit, and to which they but accustom
themselves betimes; who comfort their weariness amidst the storms of
time, by seeing far across the melancholy seas the haven they will
reach at last; who deem that every struggle has its assured reward,
and every sorrow its balm; who know, that however forsaken or bereaved
below, they never can be alone, and never deserted; that above is the
protection of Eternal power, and the mercy of Eternal love.

A celebrated Counsellor of Parliament at Douai, if he saw an apple not

The celebrated Lord Bolingbroke had an insurmountable horror of a cat:
he frequently visited the Marechale de Mirepoix, and always waited
in the anti-room till he was assured that all the cats, of which she
possessed several of a famous Angora breed, had been turned out.
These animals were so sociable, that they would sit on the large Loto
table, and whenever a counter rolled near them, they would play with
it with their paws in their usual graceful manner. I have often been
fortunate enough, says M. de Levis, to be of their party without ever
having to complain of them. One day, when the valet de chamber, after
carefully searching every where, believed there could not be a cat in
the apartment, Lord Bolingbroke came in, but immediately screamed and
rushed back; the next day it was discovered that one of the cats had
been accidentally shut up in a closet.

[Sidenote: Anne of Austria: a Sketch.]

Anne Maurice was daughter of Philippe III. King of Spain, and of
Margarette of Austria; she was born at Valladolid, on Saturday the 22nd
of September, 1601; married to Louis XIII. King of France, called “the
Just,” the 9th of November, 1615, and not till after twenty-three years
became a mother, giving birth first to Louis XIV. and next to Philippe
of France, Duke of Orléans, who married the Princess Henrietta of
England, daughter of the unfortunate Charles I. and of Henrietta sister
of Louis XIII. At the death of this monarch, his son being only _nine_
years of age, he declared Anne of Austria Regent, and during the period
of her administration, to that in which she surrendered the direction
of his kingdom, at the majority of Louis XIV. she fully justified the
election; her great strength of mind and justice of conduct never
giving way, though intestine dissention and foreign wars rendered her
task not a little arduous. More than once the Queen Regent abandoned
her capital during the tumult of the parliamentary faction, supported
by the Duke of Orléans,[15] the late King’s brother. The spirit of
discontent gave the ministry of Cardinal Mazarin as its source, but
it was long before the Queen would yield her predilection for, and
support of this minister. His eventual exile restored peace at home,
but it was not of long duration, and the Cardinal returned to negotiate
the marriage of his sovereign with the Infanta of Spain, niece to the
Queen Regent. This amiable Princess was not only chosen by Anne of
Austria as the means of restoring peace between Spain and France, but
also as interesting to her by the ties of maternal affection, being her
brother’s daughter.

Till the death of Mazarin, Louis was little conspicuous in the
administration of his government, and so much had he felt the evil
consequence of the authority and patronage assumed by the Italian
Cardinal, that he resolved to keep the reins in future wholly in his
own hands. Mazarin had been brought forward by the minister Richelieu,
and raised from obscurity; he died possessed of incalculable riches,
after having made the fortunes of all his family.[16]

The anxious affection of the Queen for her sons, was marked to the
last hour of her life; her watchful solicitude not only desired their
temporal grandeur but their moral conduct and eternal salvation, to
which her prayers were ever directed. She suffered much disquietude
from the dissipation of Louis, and though wisely endeavouring to
conceal or excuse his infidelities in the eyes of the Queen, she
remonstrated with the King on several occasions with the zeal of a
Christian, and the love of a parent; and though they failed of all
the wished for effect, the affection and duty of the King steadily
accompanied his mother to her grave. Her patience and fortitude, during
a lingering and painful disease, could not be surpassed. She died of
a cancer in the breast at sixty-five years of age; preserving, almost
unimpaired, the beauty which had rendered her in youth the subject
of universal admiration. Her attractions made her as naturally the
object of calumny as of applause, for this is the tax they ever pay.
That she had many lovers is beyond doubt, but whether she observed the
rigid propriety of conduct asserted by Mde. de Motteville, or whether
she was culpable of the indiscretions ascribed to her by less partial
authors, it is at least certain that her virtues were _great_; and
if she had faults, the neglect of her husband at the period when all
Europe bent before her perfections, gives an undisputed apology. The
cold and apathetic neglect of the gloomy Louis afforded encouragement
to less lawful admiration; and of the number of her suitors none were
more conspicuous than the accomplished English Duke of Buckingham.
Mons. Regnault Warin does not scruple to make him the father, and Anne
of Austria the mother, of the mysterious “Masque de Fer:” yet it is
hardly credible to human feeling, that a mother’s tenderness could
so far give way to state policy, as to sanction the long and cruel
imprisonment of the being to whom she gave life but to be a curse. Yet
this contradiction exists in the Memoires of the “Masque de Fer.”

The dislike of the Queen Marie de Médicis and of the minister De
Richelieu of Anne of Austria (though some pens declare this crafty
statesman to have been also the slave of her charms), greatly
strengthened the indifference of the King towards his Queen: indeed, so
much was it considered a miracle when the heir to the crown was born,
that he was surnamed the “Gift of God.”[17] It was the King’s own act
to nominate the Queen, Regent, after his death; and his confidence in
her integrity and wisdom was fully justified by her exercise of this
power. She was free from all spirit of revenge, never seeking it, even
of her worst enemies; and this was greatly evinced in her consideration
of the Queen Mary of Médicis, after she had incurred the displeasure
of Louis XIII. as well as her kind reception of the persecuted Queen
of England, when driven for refuge to the court of France. When
Princess of France, Henrietta had been often by the influence of her
mother, Mary de Médicis, guilty of acts of unkindness to her brother’s
Queen; but this never appeared in the behaviour of the latter towards
the Queen of England, whose sorrows she in every manner sought to
alleviate, and furnished her with money to send to her captive husband,
till the sad termination of his fate. The Duchess of Orléans was only
a few days old when her royal brother fled from England; and brought
up in the family of the French monarch, she was very dear to the Queen
Mother, and chosen by her as the wife of her second son, afterwards
Duke of Orléans.

[15] Likewise the Grand Condé.

[16] Louis was however, till the death of Mazarin, as well as the Queen
Mother, bound by the chain of influence and power the latter lived to
regret having allowed to the Cardinal.

    Lapt in Cythera’s golden sands,
      When first true Love was born on earth,
    Long was the doubt, what fost’ring hands
      Should tend, and rear the glorious birth.

    First Hebe claim’d the sweet employ;
      Her cup, her thornless flowers, she said,
    Would feed him best with health and joy,
      And cradle best his cherub head.

    But anxious Venus justly feared
      The tricks and changeful mind of Youth;
    Too mild, the seraph Peace appeared;
      Too stern, too cold, the matron Truth.

    Next Fancy claimed him for her own;
      But Venus disallowed her right;
    She deem’d her Iris pinions shone
      Too dazzling for his infant sight.

    To Youth, awhile, the charge was given,
      And well with Youth the cherub throve;
    Till Innocence came down from heaven,
      Sole guardian friend and nurse of Love.

    Pleasure grew mad with envious spite,
      When all preferred to her she found;
    She vow’d full vengeance for the slight,
      And soon success her purpose crown’d.

    The trait’ress watch’d a sultry hour,
      When pillow’d on her blush rose bed,
    Tired Innocence to slumber’s power
      One moment bow’d her virgin head.

      Her toys, and sugar’d poisons press’d;

que les Lazzaroni forment une famille bien distincte de celles des

[Sidenote: Origin of the title of “Sforza.”]

James Sforza, the father of Francis the first Duke, was the founder of
the house of Sforza, which gave six Dukes to Milan, and was allied with
almost every sovereign in Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. He was born in 1369, at Catignuola, near Faenza; his
father, according to tradition, was a day labourer, and to others, a
shoemaker, but probably wrought as both. Perceiving some soldiers pass,
he was struck with the desire of bearing arms. “I will go,” said he to
himself, “and dart my hatchet against that tree, and if it stick fast
in the wood I will immediately become a soldier.” The hatchet stuck
fast, and because, says the Abbot of Choisi, he threw the axe with all
his force, he assumed the supposed fortunate name of Sforza, as his
real name was Giacomuzzo, or James Attendulo.

[Sidenote: Love and Reason.]

    ’Twas in the summer time so sweet,
      When hearts and flowers were both in season,
    When, who of all the world should meet,
      One early dawn, but Love and Reason!

    Love told his dream of yesternight,
      Whilst Reason talk’d about the weather:
    The morning, sooth, was clear and bright,
      So on they took their way together.

    The boy in many a gambol flew;
      Whilst Reason like a Juno stalk’d,
    And from her portly figure threw
      A lengthen’d shadow as they walk’d.

    No wonder Love, as on they pass’d,
      Should find the sunny morning chill;
    For still the shadow Reason cast
      Follow’d the boy, and cool’d him still.

    In vain he strove his wings to warm,
      Or find a pathway not so dim;
    For still the maid’s gigantic form
      Would pass between the sun and him.

    “This must not be,” said little Love,
      “The sun was made for more than you.”
    So, turning down a myrtle grove,
      He bade the portly nymph “Adieu.”

    Now gaily roves the laughing boy
      O’er many a mead, through many a bower,
    In every breeze inhaling joy,
      And drinking bliss from every flower.

    From all the gardens, all the bowers,
      He cull’d the many sweets they shaded;
    He eat the fruits, and smelt the flowers,
      Till taste was gone, and odour faded.

    Now the sun, in pomp of noon,
      Rose high above the parched plains;
    Alas! the boy grew languid soon,
      And fever thrill’d through all his veins.

    The dew forsook his baby brow,
      No more with vivid bloom he smil’d;
    Ah! where was tranquil _Reason_ now,
      To cast her shadow o’er the child?

    Beneath a green and aged palm,
      His foot at length for shelter turning;
    He saw the maid reclining calm,
      With brow as cool as his was burning.

    “Oh take me to your bosom cold!”
      In murmurs at her feet he said,
    And Reason oped her garment’s fold,
      And flung it round his feverish head.

    He felt her bosom’s icy touch,
      And soon it lull’d his pulse to rest;
    But ah! the chill was quite too much,
      And Love expir’d on Reason’s breast.

to the giver, are not the less valuable to the receiver; which soften
the asperities of life, and by their frequent occurrence, and the
constant necessity in which we stand of them have an aggregate, if not
an individual importance. The English perhaps, as nationally possessing
the more solid virtues, may be the best friends and the most generous
benefactors; but a friendship in this more exalted acceptation of it is
rare, and beneficence almost miraculous; it is a serious question with
me, which is the most useful being in society--the light, good-humoured
Frenchman, or the slow, meditating Englishman?

who is yet living among us, and of the nation accepted for a Prophet of
truth, but his disciples call him the Son of God!

“He raises the dead! and cureth all manner of diseases: a man of
stature somewhat tall, and comely, with a very rev’rend countenance,
such as the beholders may both love and fear.

“His hair of the colour of a chestnut full ripe, down to his ears,
whence downwards it is more orient, curling and waving about his
shoulders: in the midst of his head is a seam or partition of his
hair, after the manner of the Nazarites: his forehead plain and very
delicate, his face without spot or wrinkle, beautified with a lively
red; his nose and mouth so formed as nothing can be reprehensible;
his beard thickish, in colour like his hair, and not over long, but
forked; his look innocent, but mature; his eyes gray, clear, and
quick. In reproving he is terrible, in admonishing courteous and fair
spoken, pleasant in conversation, mixed with gravity. It cannot be

hanging, and the execution took place on the 24th July. The widowed
Madame de Rileieff, who had only been a wife a few months, on the night

she went and offered a considerable bribe) the body of her husband; and
herself, laden with this dreadful but cherished burthen, hastened to
an isolated house which she occupied, where, after bathing it with her
tears, she herself prepared the mutilated remains for the grave, which
she made with her own hands in a secluded spot of the garden, solemnly
and carefully closing the earth over it. And on that spot, soon as the
stars brightened the heavens, was this poor mourner to be seen, like

morning. One winter’s night she came as usual, and knelt in prayer. The

During the march of the exiles from the splendid city of St. Petersburg
to their dreary destination, a dreadful occurrence took place whilst
crossing the forest of Yirna, during a halt in the night. The military
commandant of the escort had ordered that Albaniski, one of the exiles,
who had been guilty of some disregard of discipline, should be lashed
to a tree, about a hundred steps distant from the camp. The night was
far advanced, and the wretched culprit had appeared to resign himself
to his fate, when dreadful and repeated cries were heard through the
dense forest, awfully disturbing the silence of night: the screams
increasing, the sentinels on duty awoke their officer, but soon all
was again silent. Horrid to relate, on directing their search whence
the sounds had proceeded, they found Albaniski bathed in blood, and

The hospitality of England was so great in the remote ages, that a
chieftain even blushed to close his door: he flew to meet a stranger of
any rank, presented him with water to wash, and took from him his arms,
this being the signification that he would pass the night under his
roof, which was considered as a mark of respect and honour.

[Sidenote: Anti-Moine, or Antimony.]

The origin of the use of Anti-moine, or _Antimony_, is a remarkable
circumstance. Basil Valentin, Superior of a College of Religionists,
having observed that this mineral fattened the pigs, imagined that it
would produce the same effect on the holy brotherhood. But the case was
seriously different; the unfortunate fathers, who greedily made use of
it, died in a short time, and this is the origin of its name, according
to the pure French word. In spite of this unfortunate beginning,
_Paracelsus_ resolved to bring this mineral into practice; and by
mixing it with other preparations make it useful. The Faculty at Paris
were on this occasion divided into two parties, the one maintained that
_Antimony_ was a _poison_; the other affirmed that it was an excellent
_remedy_. The dispute became more general, and the Parliament and
the College of the Sorbonne interfered in the matter; but some time
afterwards people began to judge rightly concerning this excellent
mineral; and its wonderful and salutary effects have occasioned the
Faculty to place it among their best medicines.

In the reign of Louis XV. this curious employment had become paramount
over all other female avocations of fancy work. It consisted in
separating the bullion from the silk of gold lace, fringe, frogs,
hat loops, or sword knots, for the purpose of selling it to the Jews
at half the price of new; and it was quite ordinary to hear ladies
begging and bespeaking the spoiled finery of their male acquaintance,
to furnish material for their dexterous industry. These contributions
were termed galons. The shopkeepers, taking advantage of the folly,
invented a number of ingenious and expensive toys, composed of
_galons_. Sheep, dogs, squirrels, cradles, carriages in miniature, &c.
were offered, admired, and then pulled to pieces for “_parfilage_.”[18]
It afforded good opportunity for innumerable gallantries. A gentleman

[Sidenote: A Cottage in Scotland.]

“_God bless you; and may the field of battle never leave your heart
sair!_” It is scarcely possible to imagine a more natural and
appropriate address _from_ a soldier’s wife _to_ a soldier’s wife.
This, was the spontaneous effusion of grateful feeling, excited by some
little service which I had been the means of rendering to a soldier of
my husband’s regiment, for which his wife came to thank me. It is one
of the many instances which I have met of that species of _Ossianic_
expression (if I may be allowed the term) which distinguishes the lower
orders of the Scotch and Irish. I remember an occurrence in the life
of an unfortunate friend of mine, which not only proves how capable
this class of people are of deep and refined sentiment, but also of a
strength and pathos of language which loses nothing from the simplicity
of its guise. The lady to whom I allude, had, under circumstances of
very peculiar misfortune, in which reason, nearly shaken from its seat,
had deprived her of all sense save that of misery, been admitted to the
shelter of a cottage by the road side, in the neighbourhood of D----,
whose honest inhabitants hastened to afford her the only comforts their
power admitted; their own bed, the warmth of their peat fire, and a
share of their humble meal. They sought with kind solicitude, unmixed
with obtrusive curiosity, to learn the causes which led to the sorrow
they witnessed, but finding every effort vain, they checked their
inquiries. “Puir thing! her heart’s crushed, and her spirit broken,”
said the gudewife, whilst she placed the poor wanderer’s head upon
her homely pillow, and then seated herself with her old man by their
turf fire and unclosed the Bible, which with the Poems of Robert Burns
constituted their library.

The activity of friendship soon traced the fugitive, but no arguments
could induce those benevolent beings to accept remuneration in any
form: nearly twelve months elapsed, when, journeying south, their
former inmate sought the spot to which the “memory of the heart”
furnished the clue. The gudewife, with looks of surprise, surveyed the
handsome equipage from whence the inquiry for herself and husband was
addressed, nor could she recognise, even in the still faded form before
her, the distracted tenant of her lonely hut: on being joined by the
old man, mutual explanations took place, and by dint of many arguments,
the little offerings that had been brought for them were accepted by
these good Samaritans, as “_kip sakes from the leddy, and nae for
payment of what it was sae natural to do for a puir suffering fellow
creter_.”

    I know not if my mother’s eyes

    But as these looser leaves depart,

    Dear mother! dost thou love me yet?
      Am I remember’d in my home?
    When those I love for joy are met,
      Does some one wish that I would come?
    Thou dost--I _am_ beloved of these!

    Dear mother! dost thou love thy long-lost wanderer yet?

    Oh! when the hour to meet again
      Creeps on, and speeding o’er the sea,
    My heart takes up its lengthen’d chain,
      And link by link, draws nearer thee--
    When land is hail’d, and, from the shore,
      Comes off the blessed breath of home,
    With fragrance from my mother’s door
      Of flowers forgotten, when I come--

    When port is gain’d, and slowly now,
      The old familiar paths are past,
    And entering, unconscious how,
      _I gaze upon thy face at last_,
    And run to thee, all faint and weak,
    And feel thy tears upon my cheek--

    Oh! if my heart break not with joy,
      The light of heaven will fairer seem;
    And I shall grow once more a boy;
      And, mother, ’twill be like a dream
    That we were parted thus for years;
    And, once that we have dried our tears,
    How will the days seem long and bright,
      To meet thee always with the morn,
    And hear thy blessing every night,
      Thy “dearest,” thy “first born!”
    And he no more, as now, in a strange land forlorn.

The Torpedo is found in the British Seas, particularly at Torbay, near
Waterford, on the coast of Ireland. This extraordinary fish likes to
bury itself lightly in the sand, in which situation the Torpedo gives
its most forcible shock, and throws down the astonished passenger who
inadvertently treads upon it. On touching the fish with the fingers, it
sometimes happens that the person feels an unusual painful numbness,
which suddenly seizes the arm up to the elbow, and sometimes to the
very shoulder and head. The pain is almost indescribable, and bears
some resemblance to the sensation felt in the arm on striking the elbow
violently against a hard body. It is even affirmed that it will benumb
the astonished fisherman through the whole length of the line and rod.

The Torpedo is so far amphibious as to live in air twenty-four hours,
and but little longer in water.

feelings as to render me, (in appearance,) unmindful of the respectful
deference due to his exalted station; and with truth did the monarch
honour me by designating himself as a friend. At his death I had not
to regret only the loss of a sovereign whose condescending kindness
admitted the petitioner to his presence, but also those lengthened
conversations in which were displayed the brilliant emanations of his
highly cultivated mind, and the fruits of deep classical research: or
did I only lament the deprivation of his royal bounties. I wept for the
loss of the beneficent being, whose heart had expanded in sympathy to
the sorrows of a widowed mother, whose gracious recollections honoured
a father’s grave, and to whom in the hour of trial I never appealed in
vain. Would that my words could do justice to the devoted veneration my
heart bears him! Wit and eloquence were his to a supreme degree. None

On this anniversary of the day on which my loved little one closed

on my child’s tomb:

“Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of such
is the kingdom of heaven.”

On the monument I have referred to, an angel presents to Jesus Christ
a little boy, of age and size resembling dear C----; his hands are
clasped, and raised as in entreaty; and the sculptor has given to the
features of our Saviour all the gentle benignity of his character,
while he extends his hands to the infant claimant of heaven, and seems
to say, “Come to my bosom, there to be cradled till I replace you in
your mother’s arms.”

_Les Assassins._

Entre Antioche et la ville de Tripoli, à l’orient de Tortose, il y a
une plaine, dont l’étendue est de six milles de largeur, et de douze
milles de longueur. Elle est terminée par des groupes de petites
montagnes. Ces montagnes étaient habitées autrefois par un peuple qui
se donnait le nom d’Arsacides, prétendant être descendus du fameux
Arsace, fondateur de l’empire des Parthes, àpres la mort d’Alexandre.
Ce peuple sorti, vers le septième siècle, des confins de Perse, vers
Babylone vint former un petit état dans un coin de la Phénicie.--Ils
s’y batirent des forteresses sur des rochers inaccessibles, d’où ils
se rendaient redoutables à tous leurs voisins. Leurs brigandages et
leurs assassinats leur firent donner le nom de _Buveurs de Sang_, qu’on
changea bientôt en celui d’_Assassin_, à cause de leur arme favorite,
le poignard, qu’on appelle en Persan _Hassisan_. Les Assassins
élisaient eux-mêmes leur chef; il se nommait _le Vieux de la Montagne_,
nom fameux dans les histoires de ce temps-là. Il portait ce nom,
soit parceque le choix qu’on en faisait tombait toujours sur un des
plus anciens de la nation, soit parcequ’il habitait un chateau nommé
_Almeet_, ou _Alameet_, situé sur une haute montagne inattaquable.
Nos vieux historiens ont mal entendu l’Arabe: _Scheik_ signifie le
plus _vieux_, _senior_; mais il signifie aussi _Seigneur_. Il n’est
pas vrai que les Assassins choissient pour Prince le plus ancien de la
nation, il fallait donc traduire le _Seigneur_ de la _Montagne_. Son
empire sur ses sujets était si absolu, que fallait il commettre les
actions les plus noires, ils étaient toujours prêts à les exécuter au
premier signal qu’on leur faisait, et au péril de leur propre vie. On
les accuse de l’assassinat de Louis de Bavière, en 1231, et d’avoir
osé attenter à la vie de Saint Louis. Il parait étonnant qu’une si
monstreuse tribu ait pu se maintenir pendant près de quatre cents
ans: ce ne fut qu’en 1257 que les Tartares, sous leur roi Allan, ou
Haloan, pour délivrer leur pays de si dangereux voisins entreprirent de
massacrer leur chef et de les détruire; ce qu’ils exécutèrent.

judgment, those long years would not seem to us more than the space
of a minute. Time is an invention of our own, or at the utmost, is

agonies of such a moment might have been expressed most touchingly,
had the artist chosen to keep within the bounds of moderation: but
no, he must out-Herod Herod; and consequently, he has contrived to
make one of the most dreadful situations the human mind can conceive
actually ludicrous. The principal figure is that of a man, who, like
pious Æneas, carries his father on his back, certainly not in the most
elegant or picturesque attitude possible, while with one hand he pulls
his wife up after him rather unceremoniously. The wife, for her part,
suffers considerable inconvenience from a young gentleman behind,
who, having a mortal aversion to being drowned, has got his mother
fast hold by the hair, by means of which he almost pulls her head off
her shoulders. The whole family are certainly not very comfortably
situated, and in fact the old gentleman who is riding on his son’s
shoulders is the only one at all at his ease, and he appears to have a
very good seat, and not to care much about it. Yet I have heard this
picture lauded to the skies, both in France and England.”

Transcribers’ Note


When one or more pieces were printed on the same page, the pieces were
separated by a small decorative acorn. Here a similar symbol, ❦ has
been used to separate the pieces.

The titles of many pieces were printed in the margin, next to the start
of the piece. They are shown here as sidenotes.

Some short pieces are not mentioned in the Contents.

Footnotes have been numbered 1 to 18 and have been moved to the end of
the piece they elucidate.

Variant spelling, unconventional punctuation (for example, some opening
quotation marks are closed more than a paragraph or stanza later, and
some are not closed at all) and inconsistant hyphenation are retained.
The use of accents has not been altered. A few changes, however, have
been made, they are:

Page xvi “Pausilppo” changed to “Pausilippo” in the Contents.

Page xii the entry in the Contents for “Charles X.” has been changed to
“Charles V.”

Page 3 “Cardinal d’Estrée” changed to “Cardinal d’Estrées” in the
heading.

Page 63 “Linksum kehrt eveh marsek” has been changed to “Linksum kehrt
euch marsch”.

Page 119 “rocks” changed to “rooks” in “the rooks and the ravens came
into the towns”.

Page 153, Machevelli's age in 1494 was printed as 29, instead of 24.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
